<h2>Uncensored Thoughts is currently on hold, but you can still email me to get a spot on the list when it comes back!</h2>

<p>The writing that makes its way to my website has gone through tons and tons of hoops. I will rarely admit that I know nothing, and if I do, I put out a plan to correct that.</p>
<p>But at the same time, I'm seventeen years old, and I have tons of unformed or half-formed ideas and thoughts left inside that I actually really want to talk about.</p>
<h2>Welcome to Uncensored Thoughts.</h2>
<p>This is a list that puts out whatever I want. It's going to be written very differently from the site's content. I want to have <strong>conversations.</strong> I want people smarter than me to tell me how they feel about what I'm talking about. Here's a basic rundown of topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Personal Life, Decisions, and Struggles</li>
<li>Thoughts and Theories on Success</li>
<li>Commentary on Various Things</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically, this list is my own support/mastermind group. But instead of pitying me or telling me that I'm the best, I want people who challenge me and introduce me to new ideas.</p>
<p><a href="http://rmorabia.com/review">As I said in the Year in Review post</a>, the best way to challenge your ideas is to talk to people. This is my workaround.</p>
<p>Beware, though, I need certain types of people:</p>
<ul>
<li>People who aren't afraid of big ideas.</li>
<li>People who won't be offended easily.</li>
<li>People who like to talk, either through email or IRC.</li>
<li>People willing to be vulnerable.</li>
<li><strong>People who are okay with me sending them 3 emails a week (estimated).</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Would you be interested in this?</p>
<p>Send me an email at <a href="mailto:hi@rmorabia.com?subject=I want to join Uncensored Thoughts!">hi@rmorabia.com</a> and include your name, why you want to join, how often you're okay with being emailed, and a little about yourself.</p>
<p>I look forward to getting to know you!</p>
<p>This is an experiment part of <a href="http://rmorabia.com/change">changing my life</a>. It's turned out extraordinarily well.</p>
