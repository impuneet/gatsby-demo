<p>Let's talk about programming. Everyone says you need it these days. <a href="http://rmorabia.com/privacy">Even I do.</a> But, how should you learn to code? Codecademy, KhanAcademy, or other pseudo-learning techniques? Maybe a book, like Learn Code The Hard Way. What language should you learn, and what software should you code in? The questions are endless!</p>
<p>I'm here to give you a solution for you (and myself). Here's an 8-step guide for learning to code.</p>
<h2>Step 1: Have an end in mind.</h2>
<p>Everyone knows that goals are pointless if they're not specific. If you don't define your success, you're just flailing around randomly. Therefore, have something you want to build.</p>
<p>Think of coding like woodworking. You want to learn how to manipulate wood to make beautiful objects. Would you start hacking away randomly? No. Then why would you do that with code?</p>
<p>Have a specific goal. For me, I'd like to evolve from Wordpress and design my own website (including a blog).</p>
<p>Don't know anything practical that you could build from code? Then just aim to get through a book. Focus on doing exercises to learn the syntax/structure.</p>
<h2>Step 2: Download <a href="http://sublimetext.com">Sublime Text</a>.</h2>
<p>Sublime Text is a great text editor to start with because it supports a ton of languages. It even does Plain Text, and you can customize it to fit whatever fancy needs you have. My favorite part is that you can look like a hacker while retaining functionality.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="1074"]<img alt="" src="http://www.sublimetext.com/screenshots/alpha_goto_anything2_large.png" width="1074" height="789" /> Source: <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/blog/articles/sublime-text-2-public-alpha">Sublime Text</a>[/caption]</p>
<p>Until you've got a firmer grasp on the language of your choice, don't look for anything else that will be more efficient. Sublime is efficient enough for now.</p>
<p>NOTE: In Step 3, we'll choose a language you want to learn. If you're going to do something like iOS development, you'll need to use XCode, so make sure to confirm if Sublime Text covers the language of your choice.</p>
<h2>Step 3: Figure out what languages are needed.</h2>
<p>If you want to build a website, you'd probably need to learn HTML/CSS. If you want to build a web app, you probably still need HTML, but you might want to add on JavaScript. If you want to build an iOS app that tracks how much water you drink a day, you'd need to learn how to develop iOS apps.</p>
<p>Limit this up to two languages, preferably one. (If it is two, it'd be sequential learning: HTML before JavaScript.)</p>
<p>If you know the project you want, but don't know the languages, look for a similar application/website/app to the one you have and figure out what language it's written in (email the developer). If you're having trouble with this, email me at <a href="mailto:rmorabia@hush.com">rmorabia@hush.com</a>.</p>
<h2>Step 4: Get a reference guide for the language you're involved in.</h2>
<p>As Josh Kaufman describes in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591845556/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1591845556&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=radhimorab0c-20">The First 20 Hours</a> (about rapid skill acquisition), you do need to have some pre-research into the project. Look up the best guide for the language you want to learn, probably by searching through <a href="http://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming">/r/learnprogramming</a>.</p>
<p>If the language you want to learn is listed somewhere in <a href="http://learncodethehardway.org">Learn Code the Hard Way</a>, it's probably the best resource on the planet. Learn Code the Hard Way is a free beginner's guide that has series of exercises that teach you through repetition. It's more about you learning it on your own than being taught.</p>
<p>Only get up to 3 of these reference guides. If you get too many, you'll begin to feel overwhelmed and lose focus.</p>
<h2>Step 5: Skim through your reference guide.</h2>
<p>You don't need to do every exercise or read every page. Chances are, most won't be needed for the project you want to complete. We want results, and fast, so it's not worth it to do too much pre-research.</p>
<p>Do a couple of the beginning exercises, and if you get it, move on. If you get past halfway through the book without working on the project you want, you're doing too much pre-research. The reference guide should be just that, a <em>reference </em>guide. If you're dealing with a specific problem and it's in the books/course materials you bought, take full advantage of that and go through that section.</p>
<p>Your goal here is to get comfortable with the actual coding, the syntax, and the structure. That's it. You may also want to get comfortable with the API/documentation of the language, so you can adapt your knowledge as needed.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can try one of those interactive pseudo-learning environments (Codecademy), but you're getting used to a fake coding environment. You know how people say high school doesn't prepare you for the real world? Codecademy and other interactive tutorials are like that.</p>
<p>I highly recommend going through a book-like tutorial instead, where you have to code in a real editor. IDEs fix your errors like a spell-checker, and when learning to write code, they don't allow you to catch your own errors and learn to write properly.</p>
<h2>Step 6: Start your project.</h2>
<p>Open a new project in your editor and go at it. If you get stuck, go to <a href="http://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming">/r/learnprogramming</a> or <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">StackOverflow</a> and search around for your problem. Chances are, it's already been answered before. If not, ask, but be courteous. These are volunteer help sites, so be very specific about your problem and don't waste people's time.</p>
<p>At this point, you might also want to sign up for <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>. Chances are, this won't be a commercial project (if that's your goal, you're going to have a very hard time), so putting your code up for others to review or merging other code into your own project will be very beneficial. (Also, <a href="http://evbogue.com/dontknowshit/">learning Git is pretty important</a>.)</p>
<p>Having a look at code from projects similar to yours or debugging other people's code can rapidly increase your skills. Also, with all of the projects being open source, you'll feel like you've done a service to the world.</p>
<h2>Step 7: Spend a little bit of time every day.</h2>
<p>This might be the hardest thing you've done in a while. It's like writing your first essay in 4th grade. Looking back at it now, you can write something of that quality in 15 minutes, but at the time, the 5-paragraph essay was the hardest thing you'd ever encountered. But you worked at it a little bit each day, and eventually, you finished, making the next essay way easier.</p>
<p>Don't know how much to commit to every day? Try going until you get stuck, and then solve what you're stuck at. After you solve it, review the code really quickly, prepare for tomorrow, and go off and do something else.</p>
<p>Some days, you'll work longer, some days it'll be as short as 15 minutes, but every day you're making progress and learning something new, and that's the most important part.</p>
<h2>Step 8: Release your project and start something new.</h2>
<p>If you made an application, post it on your website and ask for feedback. As for my project, it will be visible whenever anyone looks at my site. Make sure to link to your source code on GitHub and ask some more experienced coders if they can review your code. You might not have the most elegant writing yet.</p>
<p>The 80/20 rule states that you learn 80% of a skill in 20% of the time. You're well on your way to getting that mark of mastery. After realizing that you can make project #1, you should realize that you can code almost anything you use on your computer. The power of computing is in your hands, so go forth and take it.</p>
<h1>Helpful Hints to Make Coding Less Painful:</h1>
<ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Never Copy/Paste. </strong>If you have a solution to your problem, type it out into the editor. It stays in your brain better and you can take the time to understand every character that you're typing in. Next time you encounter the same or a similar problem, you'll remember what you have to input.</li>
<li><strong>Never doubt the project or the technicalities within it. </strong>When you get stuck, you may think you chose something useless, and maybe it'd be better to start a new project. Unless your goal is to make the new Google (although a simple search engine is quite manageable), you should stick with what you chose. Learning one language will make it substantially easier to learn the next. Stick with what you have until your needs outgrow it. (It won't be in the first project, trust me.)</li>
<li><strong>Remember that this is supposed to be hard. </strong>If this was easy, companies like Facebook and Google would be out of business. You're taking control now, and that will always be a bit difficult.</li>
<li><strong>Don't think there will be monetary benefits from this. </strong>You are not going to build a software you can sell yet, and doing one simple project will not land you a job. Focus on the end, and make sure that end is only to build and complete this project, which will make your life easier and serve a purpose for your unique situation.</li>
<li><strong>Remember that you are not alone. </strong>There are plenty of communities out there that can help you if you get stuck, or just offer support. You can probably find a coding mentor or a 24/7 IRC channel that can help, too. The support for people new to code is endless, and as long as you value the other people on the end of the line, they will help you out.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>Really, it's all about being specific and not stressing about the small stuff. <a href="http://www.uncollege.org/5-takeaways-from-benjamin-franklin/">As we learned from Benjamin Franklin</a>, all you have to do is proceed forward purposefully.</p>
<p>Good luck in your coding endeavors. If you want to update me or if you need (non-technical) help, feel free to email me anytime at <a href="mailto:rmorabia@hush.com">rmorabia@hush.com</a> or leave a comment below.</p>
