<p>I've raved about <a href="http://hpmor.com">Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality</a> multiple times before, within my <a href="http://rmorabia.com/thoughts">private list</a> and <a href="http://rmorabia.com/think">on my website</a>.</p>
<p>I finally finished the entire Harry Potter series, so I allowed myself to (re)start HPMOR. Even though it's fiction and beyond that, it's <i>fan</i>fiction, there are lessons abound. I think I like it so much because I am Harry Potter in the story. He's curious, tries to be rational, he reads a ton, he hates those supposedly smart kids who have no creativity, he has a hard time controlling irrational anger, and he wants to prove his greatness and change the world. Granted, it's odd that I identify with an 11-year old, but in every story, there's one element you have to ignore in order for the story to move forward. In this case, it's Harry's maturity and his intelligence at such a young age.</p>
<p>Today I'm sharing the lessons from the first 10 chapters. This will continue as a series, probably 10 chapters each time. Spoilers ahead, I think.</p>
<p>(If you want to read Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality, which I highly recommend you do, head over to <a href="http://hpmor.com">http://hpmor.com</a>. You can read it online, through the high-quality podcast, on your Kindle, or you can even print out a book-style PDF. There is no excuse you can give me about why you can't read this.)</p>
<h2>Chapter 1: A Day of Very Low Probability</h2>
<blockquote><p>"If you want to win this argument with Dad, look in chapter two of the first book of the Feynman Lectures on Physics. There's a quote there about how <b>philosophers say a great deal about what science absolutely requires, and it is all wrong, because the only rule in science is that the final arbiter is observation - that you just have to look at the world and report what you see.</b>"<br />
</p></blockquote>
<p>Enough said. Insights are a little scant while the story is being set up, but after Chapter 7, it almost gets overwhelming.</p>
<h2>Chapter 2: Everything I Believe is False</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>"You don't have to," Harry said. "We've performed a definitive experiment. But..." Harry hesitated. He couldn't help himself. <b>Actually, under the circumstances, he</b><b><em>shouldn't </em></b><b>be helping himself. It was right and proper to be curious.</b> "What else <em>can</em> you do?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Harry's intelligence and the sheer amount of opportunities he encounters every day area product of his curiosity. The entire driving point of the story is that Harry's basically the first curious wizard--ever. In the actual series, I identified with Hermione Granger, because she read and researched everything she could, but it wasn't out of as much curiosity as Harry in HPMOR. Hermione's awesome (at least in the first 4 books, she got butchered after), but too into school. HPMOR Harry does what he does because he wants to and he's curious, not just for school.</p>
<h2>Chapter 3: Comparing Reality To Its Alternatives</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The Dark Lord had raged upon wizarding Britain like a wilding wolf, tearing and rending at the fabric of their everyday lives. Other countries had wrung their hands but hesitated to intervene, whether out of apathetic selfishness or simple fear, for whichever was first among them to oppose the Dark Lord, their peace would be the next target of his terror.</p>
<p>(<b><em>The bystander effect,</em></b> <b>thought Harry, thinking of Latane and Darley's experiment which had shown that you were more likely to get help if you had an epileptic fit in front of one person than in front of three.</b> <b><em>Diffusion of responsibility, everyone hoping that someone else would go first.</em></b>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pretty simple. I already knew about this.</p>
<h2>Chapter 4: The Efficient Market Hypothesis</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>"Yes, but -" Harry pleaded. "I'm sure that when I'm an adult I'll want one. And I <em>can</em> afford one. <b>Logically, it would make just as much sense to buy it now instead of later, and get the use of it right away. It's the same money either way, right?</b> I mean, I <em>would</em> want a good one, with <em>lots</em> of room inside, good enough that I wouldn't have to just get a better one later..." Harry trailed off hopefully.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Two requisites for this: 1) Make sure that the object has a seriously long lifespan, and isn't just a throwaway item. In this case, Harry is buying an expandable trunk, which should last him his entire lifetime, or at a minimum, his entire career at Hogwarts. 2) Make sure this investment doesn't make you fall into debt. Debt is horrendous and terrible and I never want to be in it. You can make this investment out of your savings, though.</p>
<h2>Chapter 5: The Fundamental Attribution Error</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>"Well..." Harry said, trying to figure out how to describe that particular bit of Muggle science [the fundamental attribution error]. "Suppose you come into work and see your colleague kicking his desk. You think, 'what an angry person he must be'. Your colleague is thinking about how someone bumped him into a wall on the way to work and then shouted at him. <em>Anyone</em> would be angry at that, he thinks. When we look at others we see personality traits that explain their behaviour, but when we look at ourselves we see circumstances that explain our behaviour. People's stories make internal sense to them, from the inside, but we don't see people's histories trailing behind them in the air. We only see them in one situation, and we don't see what they would be like in a different situation. <b>So the fundamental attribution error is that we explain by permanent, enduring traits what would be better explained by circumstance and context.</b>" There were some elegant experiments which confirmed this, but Harry wasn't about to go into them.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Chapter 6: The Planning Fallacy</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Harry had always been frightened of ending up as one of those child prodigies that never amounted to anything and spent the rest of their lives boasting about how far ahead they'd been at age ten. But then most adult geniuses never amounted to anything either. There were probably a thousand people as intelligent as Einstein for every actual Einstein in history. <b>Because those other geniuses hadn't gotten their hands on the one thing you absolutely needed to achieve greatness. They'd never found an important problem.</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Screw child prodigies. Harry and I have found problems.</p>
<blockquote><p>"Muggle researchers have found that people are always very optimistic, compared to reality. Like they say something will take two days and it takes ten days, or they say it'll take two months and it takes over thirty-five years. For example, in one experiment, they asked students for times by which they were 50% sure, 75% sure, and 99% sure they'd complete their homework, and only 13%, 19%, and 45% of the students finished by those times. And they found that the reason was that when they asked one group for their best-case estimates if everything went as well as possible, and another group for their average-case estimates if everything went as usual, they got back answers that were statistically indistinguishable. See, if you ask someone what they expect in the <em>normal</em> case, they visualise what looks like the line of maximum probability at each step along the way - everything going according to plan, with no surprises. But actually, since more than half the students didn't finish by the time they were 99% sure they'd be done, <b>reality usually delivers results a little worse than the 'worst-case scenario'. It's called the planning fallacy, and the best way to fix it is to ask how long things took the last time you tried them.</b> That's called using the outside view instead of the inside view. But when you're doing something new and can't do that, you just have to be really, really, really pessimistic. Like, so pessimistic that reality actually comes out <em>better</em> than you expected around as often and as much as it comes out worse. It's actually <em>really hard</em> to be <em >so</em> pessimistic that you stand a decent chance of <em>undershooting</em> real life. ..."<br />
</p></blockquote>
<p>Document everything and extract patterns from it, then let that influence your future decisions.</p>
<h2>Chapter 7: Reciprocation</h2>
<blockquote><p>"I ask the <b>fundamental question of rationality: Why do you believe what you believe?</b> What do you think you know and how do you think you know it?"<br />
</p></blockquote>
<p>Be willing to change your mind in light of poor reasoning. Be able to admit that you're wrong.</p>
<blockquote><p>The same could be said of Draco's clever use of <b>reciprocation</b> pressure for an unsolicited gift, a technique which Harry had read about in his social psychology books (<b>one experiment had shown that an unconditional gift of $5 was twice as effective as a conditional offer of $50 in getting people to fill out surveys</b>).</p></blockquote>
<p>Reciprocation is an evil, evil advantage. Use it <i>all the time</i>. The results I've gotten are amazing (usually not monetary).</p>
<h2>Chapter 8: Positive Bias</h2>
<blockquote><p>"Really," the boy said in a slightly strangled voice. "I hope you don't mind if I test that - it's not that I don't believe you, but as the saying goes,<b> 'Trust, but verify'. No point in wondering when I can just do the experiment.</b>"<br />
</p></blockquote>
<p>It's really absurd often it's really easy to get a conclusion, yet we continue to just wonder/theorize. I'm a constant victim to this.</p>
<blockquote><p>"What you've just discovered is called '<b>positive bias</b>'," said the boy. "<b>You had a rule in your mind, and you kept on thinking of triplets that should make the rule say 'Yes'. </b><b>But you didn't try to test any triplets that should make the rule say 'No'.</b> In fact you didn't get a <em>single</em> 'No', so 'any three numbers' could have just as easily been the rule. It's sort of like how people imagine experiments that could confirm their hypotheses instead of trying to imagine experiments that could falsify them - that's not quite exactly the same mistake but it's close. You have to learn to look on the negative side of things, stare into the darkness. When this experiment is performed, only 20% of grownups get the answer right. And many of the others invent fantastically complicated hypotheses and put great confidence in their wrong answers since they've done so many experiments and everything came out like they expected."<br />
</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Get a grip, Hermione. This one was easy.</p>
<p>Not a lesson, but an amazing quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>"I warn you that challenging my ingenuity is a dangerous project, and tends to make your life a lot more surreal."<br />
</p></blockquote>
<h2>Chapter 9: Self-Awareness, Part I</h2>
<p>There are no lessons in this chapter, since it acts as  a set-up for the amazing Chapter 10.</p>
<h2>Chapter 10: Self-Awareness, Part II</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Now it was the Hat's thoughts that were slow, hesitant. <em>"I must Sort for the good of all the students in all the Houses... but I think you could learn to be a good Hufflepuff, and not too out of place there. <b>You will be happier in Hufflepuff than in any other house; that is the truth."</b></em></p>
<p><b>Happiness is not the most important thing in the world to me.</b> I would not become all that I could be, in Hufflepuff. <b>I would sacrifice my potential.<br />
</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's plenty that's more important than happiness.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Destruction is always easier than creation. Easier to tear things apart, to disrupt, than to put them back together again.</b> If I have the potential to accomplish good on a massive scale, I must also have the potential to accomplish still greater evil... But I won't do that.<br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't know what to think about this yet<em>. </em>I haven't read far enough in to know what happens.<br />
</p>
<blockquote><p>"...you<em> know </em>em>that by far the simplest explanation for this unverbalisable fear of yours is just <b>the fear of losing your fantasy of greatness, of disappointing the people who believe in you, of turning out to be pretty much ordinary, of flashing and fading like so many other child prodigies...</b>"</p></blockquote>
<p>Again, no real lesson, since we don't know the ending. But it's powerful and important to note.<br />
</p>
