<p>I walked into Cat’s Cradle unknowing of the brilliance that is Vonnegut. I was browsing through the Classics section searching for some 20th century literature [that isn’t Kerouac] and chanced upon a collection of mid-life works of Kurt Vonnegut. I’d only heard his name before, and <a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/tag/kurt-vonnegut/">read a few letters</a>, but Cat’s Cradle was the first work of fiction of his I read.</p>

<p>I didn’t realize this was a sci-fi novel. The first few pages reminded me of Ayn Rand, preaching me some philosophy that was self-made and obnoxious. I didn’t understand the point of going through the[se seemingly irrelevant] events of John’s life as a writer. I went as far as to almost skip the vignette on how ice-nine works! (If you haven’t read it yet, don’t skip that part!) I knew that I liked the book, I just didn’t understand how it all tied together. It was about page 130 (out of ~180, in my dictionary-styled collection) that I saw all of the events, information, and narration coming together. And boy, was it glorious!</p>

<p>The climax had me eager for the ending, but when I finally reached the final page, I was shocked at how sudden it was. This isn’t to say it’s bad, it’s actually quite good. I can’t help but feel that every line has an underlying meaning to it, especially the ending. To appease this, I definitely need to read more into the reasons for the book’s genesis, along with the philosophies and activism of the author, and come back for a re-read.</p>

<p>Overall, it was a quick read (3 days) that had so much more to offer than expected. It exhibits the brevity and cynicism that I absolutely adore in 20th century lit, and although the author bio starts with “Like his idol Mark Twain,” Cat’s Cradle is infinitely superior to The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. I never got to the end of that one.</p>

<h3>Personal Notes</h3>
<p>Following along with <a href="http://www.ryanholiday.net/read-to-lead-how-to-digest-books-above-your-level/">how Ryan Holiday approaches reading</a>, I wish I would’ve done the same with Cat’s Cradle. Sure, there’s a thrill in uncovering the ending as you read, but if I had explored beforehand, I wouldn’t have to re-read.</p>
<p>There are two books I’m reading this week, Lolita and Vonnegut’s next novel, God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater. Lolita is going to take time, and I must digest it at an incredibly slow rate, for reasons I can’t explain. I’m going to try the Holiday method for God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, however. We’ll see how that changes things.</p>
<p>Sadly, I can’t highlight, as these are the library’s copies. Perhaps I’ll find an alternative method.</p>
