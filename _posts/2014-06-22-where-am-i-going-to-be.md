Where am I going to be one year, five years, and fifty years from now?

# The 1-Year Plan

- Make $1,000 a month.
- Start going through the legalities of moving. (Be out by August of 2015.)

# The 5-Year Plan

- Be comfortable in regards to finances, health (mental and physical), and status.
- Either have the long-term travelling plan started, or be ready to go in a matter of months.
- Reach 1,000 true fans (or 100 true customers).

# The 50-Year Plan

- Be the puppetmaster of my revolution.
- Mentor someone who will have an even bigger impact than me.
- Have an amazing public personal database built up.
