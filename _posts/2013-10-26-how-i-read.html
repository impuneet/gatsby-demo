<p>I was a pretty good reader as a kid. My mom recounts me sitting in the corner reading in pre-school instead of doing whatever other pre-schoolers did. In Kindergarten, I was praised for reading more books than any other kid. Throughout the elementary school summers, I dominated the summer reading programs in all the neighboring cities.</p>
<p>Eventually, I started to realize that all of these books are the same. Sometime when I was 10, I started to realize every book seemed to be about some derpy kid who eventually overcame his fears and saved the world, or at least his friend group.</p>
<p>I had the intellectual ability to read YA and adult books at the time, but not the emotional maturity. So, I hit a standstill.</p>
<p>Time passes on, I get into Classics (aka: any title whose name being uttered made me sound smart). I got a Kindle and subsequently got into Indie trash, at one point reading one book per day. Then the Kindle broke and I had no clue what to do.</p>
<p>I went through a massive overhaul on how I thought about reading, which leads us to how I read today.</p>
<p>I can't say I read a lot, but I read enough. I'm constantly trying to challenge myself to read more, but still keep up a deliberate pace. In case you didn't know, <a href="http://www.rmorabia.com/consumption-1/">here's what I've been reading</a>.</p>
<p>I'm a firm believer in constantly challenging your own ideas against others'. Hopefully, this post inspires you to read more or change up how you read.</p>
<p>This post is going to be divided up into three parts even though the title says it's only one. Why I Read, What I Read, and How I Read. They're all equally important things to define.</p>
<h1>Why I Read</h1>
<p>The struggles I had with reading came from being unable to define why I read. Somewhere in the first half of 2013, <a href="http://inoveryourhead.net/how-to-read-a-book-a-week-in-2010/">Julien Smith's articles about books</a> (which I don't really like anymore because they led me to fall into that Indie trash trap), somehow led me to <a href="http://www.ryanholiday.net/read-to-lead-how-to-digest-books-above-your-level/">Ryan Holiday's post on how he reads</a>, and I fell into the the rabbit hole of Ryan's reading philosophy. This rapidly developed how I approached reading.</p>
<p>Reading 50 or 100 books a year means nothing if you're reading Stephen King or Agatha Christie or Suzanne Collins. Nothing these authors write provides any insight on how to live life or how to view other people living life.</p>
<p><strong>You read to gain insight.</strong> It's an investment of wisdom. You read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0140442103/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0140442103&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=radhimorab0c-20">really smart people's advice</a>, or you read to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0446310786/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0446310786&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=radhimorab0c-20">understand a different time that shaped your own time</a>, or you read about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0486290735/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0486290735&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=radhimorab0c-20">world changers, and how they're not that different from you</a>.</p>
<p>I was part of a community where it was so easy to fall into the filter bubble. If you were unhealthy, if you hated school, if you were a loser, you could always find people to validate anything you did, said, or believed. There was a specific post going around that said something along the lines of "Those who have a higher IQ are more susceptible to depression because they see the world more clearly."</p>
<p>This went crazy-viral. No source. No backing. Just people getting to hear what they want to hear. Same thing with a lot of feminist statements and the people who want a higher minimum wage (anyone who's read anything about behavior economics knows that a minimum wage is terrible for the economy). I could go on and on--people who believe the US economy is a true capitalist economy, people who believe they know how the education system works, and <a title="How to Stay Alive in the New World" href="http://www.rmorabia.com/privacy/">people who believe internet security and privacy doesn't matter</a>.</p>
<p>You're not allowed to speak until you've done <a href="http://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2013/04/the-work-required-to-have-an-opinion/">the work required to have an opinion</a>.</p>
<p>There's so much more to say about why I read, but I'll just put into a bulleted list of the major reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>New perspectives.</li>
<li>Frameworks for decision-making.</li>
<li>Insights on how to live life.</li>
<li>Insights on success.</li>
<li>Understanding people.</li>
<li>Challenging myself.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you can't see any benefit to reading books yet (other than a despised reading Stephen King for pleasure), <a href="mailto:hi@rmorabia.com">email me</a> and introduce who you are and why reading will not help you in life. Articulating your own excuses might enlighten about your own aversion to challenge.</p>
<p>Reading books is a practical investment for my future. If I spend as much on books as you are on your iPhone ($99 for the phone +  $30 on your data plan monthly, and that's a lot less than what most people pay), I assure you that my lack of Instagram will take me a lot further in life than you.</p>
<h1>What I Read</h1>
<p>As I said above, I don't read Stephen King. I hate <em>The Hunger Games</em>, <em>Divergent</em>, everything John Green writes, and Indie trash. If you consider yourself to be pursuing an education through books and making an investment by buying these books, you have the wrong idea.</p>
<p>First of all, I read very deliberately. Although my <a href="http://amzn.com/w/V9ZYYLHO3DXP ">To-Buy List on Amazon </a>(Seriously, buy me books.) has reached 627 items, most are very deliberate choices. If you choose a certain title, I can tell you exactly why I want the book, where I probably got the recommendation from, and I'll tell you how sad I am because it'll take me a long time to get to that book.</p>
<p>If you caught that, all of my reading comes from a recommendation of some sort. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Classics">The Harvard Classics</a>, <a href="http://www.ryanholiday.net/reading-newsletter/">Ryan Holiday</a>, <a href="http://www.ryanholiday.net/reading-newsletter/">Farnam Street</a> and other blogs, word of mouth, and of course, simple association. For example, reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0140283293/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0140283293&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=radhimorab0c-20"><em>On The Road</em> by Jack Kerouac </a>would lead me to read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0872860051/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0872860051&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=radhimorab0c-20"><em>The First Third</em> by Neal Cassady</a>, a memoir of the guy the main character of <em>On The Road</em> was based on.</p>
<p>I don't look at best-seller lists or "100 Books You Have To Read Before You Die." I assess my interests and find credible people to tell me what to read in that category.</p>
<p>At the same time, I know a lot of people who say "I don't read fiction anymore. When there's so much actionable non-fiction out there, why would I waste my time reading fiction?" These people are confusing fiction with pleasure. Anyone who's taken a crack at Ulysses knows that fiction is anything but pleasure.</p>
<p>If you're one of those people (although I bet all you read are pseudo-business and pseudo-self-help books), read <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0486278077/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0486278077&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=radhimorab0c-20">The Picture of Dorian Gray</a></em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0486278077/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0486278077&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=radhimorab0c-20"> by Oscar Wilde</a>. If you learn nothing about life, ethics, philosophy, and psychology from that, you're a hopeless case.</p>
<p>As you can probably tell, It doesn't have to seem very practical, like reading a Statistics textbook. You just have to approach it with an end in mind. For example, I'm on a bit of a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0679723161/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0679723161&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=radhimorab0c-20">post-WWII</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312428812/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0312428812&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=radhimorab0c-20">America</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0140283293/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0140283293&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=radhimorab0c-20">craze</a>. This doesn't yield any practical benefits, but it helps me understand what it means to be an American and how that's influenced who we are today.</p>
<p>Notice that the books I linked aren't generally approached with an end in mind. They're all simply novels that people hold in a high regard. But I read differently than a lot of people.</p>
<p>Before we get into how I read, there's a point that's worth mentioning:</p>
<h2>Why Value Books Over Other Mediums?</h2>
<p>As mentioned before, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0486278077/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0486278077&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=radhimorab0c-20">I do value other mediums as much as books</a>. Each medium has their own strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p>But if you want to reach the widest arsenal of wisdom, knowledge, and perspective, books have a track record for sticking around.</p>
<p>Movies and images have only been around for a little over 100 years, and video games for only 40. The periodical changes so rapidly that it's hard to know what's what.</p>
<p>And if you're suggesting music, visual art, and dance--if you know how to interpret that, you're on a different level.</p>
<p>Basically, books are accessible, allow you to go up to 2000 years back in history, and most of the time--the meaning's right there on the page.</p>
<p>Seriously, I get to read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812968255/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0812968255&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=radhimorab0c-20">the first-hand thoughts of the last great emperor of the Pax Romana</a>. It doesn't get cooler than that.</p>
<p>The resources and skills needed to write a book about your experiences is much lower than any other medium. That's why I can read about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0140439188/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0140439188&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=radhimorab0c-20">the experiences of a former slave</a>. There's no way any newspaper would've published him and there's no way he would've been trained enough to write a sonata about his struggles.</p>
<p>Douglass learned to write through the Bible, and went on to write books that changed lives.</p>
<p>At the same time, there's a bit of a quality standard for books. Note, a bit. <a href="http://farnamstreetblog.com">Shane Parrish</a> talks about this a bit. He theorizes that if something's still in print after 50 years, it's probably of quality.</p>
<p>I encourage people to partake in all kinds of mediums. Academic literature, books, video games, films, visual art, and music all hold a ton of value. But if you're looking for the easiest way to learn with the widest arsenal of knowledge and a system that curates itself, I suggest books.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>To conclude "What I Read," let's see what some smart people have to say about what to read:</p>
<blockquote><p>If the book we are reading does not wake us, as with a fist hammering on our skull, why then do we read it? <cite><a href="http://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2012/01/if-the-book-we-are-reading-does-not-wake-us-why-then-do-we-read-it/">Franz Kafka</a></cite></p></blockquote>
<p>He answered this question by saying that "a book should serve as an ice-axe to break the frozen sea within us."</p>
<blockquote><p>And so we became friends. This happened in October.</p>
<p>The better I got to know Nagasawa, the stranger he seemed. I had met a lot of strange people in my day, but none as strange as Nagasawa. He was a far more voracious reader than I, but he made it a rule never to touch a book by any author who had not been dead at least thirty years. “That’s the only kind of book I can trust,” he said.</p>
<p>“It’s not that I don’t believe in contemporary literature,” he added, “but I don’t want to waste valuable time reading any book that has not had the baptism of time. Life is too short.”</p>
<p>“What kind of authors do you like?” I asked, speaking in respectful tones to this man two years my senior. “Balzac, Dante, Joseph Conrad, Dickens,” he answered without hesitation.</p>
<p>“Not exactly fashionable.”</p>
<p>“That’s why I read them. <strong>If you only read the books that everyone else is reading, you can only think what everyone else is thinking.</strong> That’s the world of hicks and slobs. Real people would be ashamed of themselves doing that. Haven’t you noticed, Watanabe? You and I are the only real ones in the dorm. The other guys are crap.”</p>
<p>This took me off guard. “How can you say that?”</p>
<p>“’ Cause it’s true. I know. I can see it. It’s like we have marks on our foreheads. …” <cite><a href="http://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2013/04/if-you-only-read-the-books-that-everyone-else-is-reading-you-can-only-think-what-everyone-else-is-thinking/">Haruki Murakami</a></cite></p></blockquote>
<p>I hope it's written on my forehead that I'm real.</p>
<p>Finally, from Seneca:</p>
<blockquote><p>The primary indication, to my thinking, of a well-ordered mind is a man’s ability to remain in one place and linger in his own company. Be careful, however, lest this reading of many authors and books of every sort may tend to make you discursive and unsteady. You must linger among a limited number of master-thinkers, and digest their works, if you would derive ideas which shall win firm hold in your mind. Everywhere means nowhere. When a person spends all his time in foreign travel, he ends by having many acquaintances, but no friends. And the same thing must hold true of men who seek intimate acquaintance with no single author, but visit them all in a hasty and hurried manner. Food does no good and is not assimilated into the body if it leaves the stomach as soon as it is eaten; nothing hinders a cure so much as frequent change of medicine; no wound will heal when one salve is tried after another; a plant which is often moved can never grow strong. There is nothing so efficacious that it can be helpful while it is being shifted about. And in reading of many books is distraction.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Each day acquire something that will fortify you against poverty, against death, indeed against other misfortunes as well; and after you have run over many thoughts, select one to be thoroughly digested that day. This is my own custom; from the many things which I have read, I claim some one part for myself.<cite><a href="http://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2013/07/seneca-on-reading/">Seneca</a></cite></p></blockquote>
<h1>How I Read</h1>
<p>Here it comes, the part that you've all been waiting for.</p>
<p>I don't simply pick up a book and read it from cover to cover. It's a process. Yes, it's the same process for fiction and non-fiction.</p>
<h2>Step 1: Before Opening the Book</h2>
<p>I only buy books if I get them on Free Shipping, which gives me at least a week to do my pre-research.</p>
<p>The point of this is to have the effect of re-reading a book the first time I read it. You're able to catch the author's little hints of foreshadowing and significance the first time you read it. Otherwise, lines like this: "Oh, my poor Charlotte, do not hate me in your eternal heaven among an eternal alchemy of asphalt and rubber and metal and stone--but thank God, not water, not water!" float right above your head.</p>
<p>(That line's from <em>Lolita </em>by Vladimir Nabokov that foreshadows the character Charlotte's death. If you were going to read the book, sorry for spoiling. But if you were going to read it right, it doesn't matter.)</p>
<p>So, during my week of downtime, here's what I do:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Read the Wikipedia page of the book.</strong> Skip the plot summary, not to avoid the spoilers, but only to avoid the amateur writing. You'll get a good feel of the controversy, the significance, and the legacy through this and select linked sources.</li>
<li><strong>Read critical reviews. </strong>This isn't possible for a lot of books, but if you're reading anything 20th century, it's pretty easy to find something on the New York Times, The New Yorker, The NY Review of Books, The Chicago Tribune, etc.. If your book is older, look for an anniversary post about the legacy of the book. <em>Note</em>: Don't just settle for one review. Read all that you can.</li>
<li><strong>Read reviews on Amazon. </strong>You should already be looking at this to check if you have an Abridged version and information about the translation (if that's relevant). Reading a couple of reviews on Amazon (new, top, and 2-stars) will help you gain some perspective on what the modern readers who aren't getting paid to write talk about.</li>
<li><strong>Don't cringe at spoilers. </strong>Again, we're not reading for pleasure here. When I started reading real books, I found out that the endings were explicitly stated by the author in the first chapter anyway. (eg. In <em>The Virgin Suicides</em>, Eugenides tells you that the five Lisbon girls commit suicide within the year. Why would you think any different?) Seriously, it doesn't matter. It doesn't ruin the fun. To me, it maximizes it.</li>
<li><strong>Read the author's Wikipedia page. </strong>Yes, the whole thing. You're trying to understand who they are, why they're writing this book, and what they want you to get out of it. Understand how their particular upbringing influenced their stories and understand how the legacy of the book affected the author.</li>
<li><strong>Read or watch author interviews. </strong>Wikipedia can give you an idea of how other people view your author, but interviews where the author is given free reign to talk about their own books, life, and legacy are the most valuable sources you can come across. If your author is too old, look for "legacy" posts on the character of the author or reviews of biographies that came out.</li>
</ul>
<p>This shouldn't take you more than a few hours. You don't have to read everything word for word, you're trying to gain insight on how to approach the book you're reading. We're trying to approach a certain framework for how you interpret the book based on the author's views and the views of the audience the book was written for.</p>
<h2>Step 2: As You Read the Book</h2>
<p>First, take a moment to breathe in the fresh smell of book. We're going to be tearing these books apart very, very soon. Enjoy the freshness while it lasts.</p>
<p>Especially if you bought a cheap book (these are those Dover Thrift Editions which go for under $5), your book is going to go through a huge makeover. You might even want to take before and after pictures.</p>
<p>Let me show you a couple of pictures of my copy of <em>The Virgin Suicides</em> by Jeffrey Eugenides. I'm choosing this book in particular because it's not an academic book. You will never find it being listed in a recommended reading list for anyone in school or on those "100 Books To Read Before You Die" lists.</p>
<p>It was published 20 years ago and can be approached as a casual read. I chose differently.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="book1" src="/css/images/Picture-004.jpg"/></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="book2" src="/css/images/Picture-005.jpg"/></p>
<p>As I hope you can see from the above images, I use a couple of different tools to aid my reading process.</p>
<p>It's important to note that this isn't the average I mark books up. My copy of <em>The Virgin Suicides </em>still looks fairly new and doesn't have as many tabs and post-its inserted as my other books. <strong>Your books will get marked up.</strong></p>
<p>Anyway, here's my reading toolbox, per say:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Book Itself. </strong>This is just a reminder to not get so caught up in the tools and have it cripple your reading ability. It's really visible in my books that there are long periods where I don't make any marks, and in some parts I mark it up more than necessary. You'll rarely be in the ideal environment to mark it up as much as you want.</li>
<li><strong>Cell Phone. </strong>Don't skimp on defining. I think it's important to know what the words mean, because the author chose them for a reason. The little details about the word could make a sentence have a whole new meaning. (Or I could just be studying for the SATs and need the biggest arsenal of vocabulary that I can get.) But I don't have a smartphone, and Google recently disabled their search-by-text service. Through meticulous searching, I came across an Indian start-up that isn't as good as Google, but it does the job if you don't have a smart phone. <a href="http://www.txtweb.com">Link here.</a> If you do have a smart phone, just install a Dictionary app and use it. (If you don't live in the US or India and you don't have a smart phone, sorry. Do some searching on your own for alternatives.)</li>
<li><strong>Highlighter. </strong>I highlight [short] passages that have an impact on me (the quotes that get posted on this site) and certain phrases that stand out  to me (like when the author is sassy). Pretty much anything that I think deserves that fluorescent pink surrounding it.</li>
<li><strong>Big Post-Its. </strong>The default size when you think of post-its. A lot of words can fit on here and it can easily obscure half of the page, so I use these pretty conservatively. Usually, it's to theorize or summarize. I always have one used to reflect on the book right after I finish, though.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007QFATEO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B007QFATEO&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=radhimorab0c-20">Little Post-Its.</a> </strong>I use the post-it page markers, because I can usually fit one to two lines of commentary on there. This commentary can be clarification (there's a part in <em>The Picture of Dorian Gray</em> where he enters an opium den and there are a bunch of oriental people. Wilde shows their race by certain characteristics, so I got my page markers and defined each description into the actual race.) or just an outburst of feelings (one of the page markers above says "MEN? NO LUX, NO!!"). These are used a lot more frequently and at times I have more than 4 on one page. (Linked to Amazon because my description may not be clear and you may not just have these lying around the house.)</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PMGD4Y/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PMGD4Y&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=radhimorab0c-20">Post-It Flags.</a> </strong>I use a four-color system just because I can, but at a minimum, you just need two. I'll elaborate further on my system below. (The link on Amazon is very expensive, but those are the exact ones I use, which is important when I start explaining it. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006JNMH/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00006JNMH&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=radhimorab0c-20">Here's a much cheaper version.</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Pen. </strong>Duh, you can't write on the Post-Its without a pen. (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006IEBI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00006IEBI&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=radhimorab0c-20">Psst, here's my favorite pen ever.</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes,  I carry all of this around with me wherever and whenever I read (exception: big post-its. I just don't use them enough to quantify bringing them).</p>
<p>And yes, I carry a book with me wherever I can. If I'm going to be sitting in a waiting room anyway, better be productive. I suggest you do the same.</p>
<p>Let me explain how I use the Post-It flags.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Red means Highlight. </strong>This is only for the passages that stand out to me. I don't mark red for sassy remarks.</li>
<li><strong>Yellow means Passage.</strong> This is a little vague. Basically, if there's a passage that's too long to highlight (a majority of a page or even multiple pages), I mark that with yellow.</li>
<li><strong>Blue means Reference. </strong>There are three reasons to flag something with blue. First, when something in-context of the story is revealed that may be important later, to reference in the future to compare character development or the message of the book. Second, if something is relevant to my ulterior motive to reading the book (book report for school, important references to the era, etc.). Third, if there's a highlighted remark that isn't really a quote, but that really stands out to me stylistically. (<em>Note</em>: Not all unquoted highlights count. Only the ones that really, really stand out.)</li>
<li><strong>Green means Confusion. </strong>Even if you read a book 10 times, you may not understand why an author put that specific passage there. Marking something with a green flag tells you to focus on this quote the next time you read it. Or, this could mean that you have to look something up on Wikipedia (In <em>The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin</em>, he talks about his family's religion and changes in their religion and I had no clue what the differences between these religions were, so I looked it up).</li>
</ul>
<p>Yeah, this is a little excessive. At a bare minimum to annotate in the same way that I do, I'd need the book, a pen, my cell phone, a highlighter, and any-colored flags.</p>
<p>I'd write in the margins, combine Reference, Passages, and Highlights into a single color, and just put the flag in a certain way to mean I'm confused (at the top of the page instead of the side). I find this to be less convenient, but it's highly doable.</p>
<p>These were simply the resources I was given when I said I wanted to annotate my books, and I adapted as such.</p>
<p>In no way am I endorsing my own ways as better than anyone else's, but hopefully, exposure to my system makes you re-think yours.</p>
<p>The whole point of having this system, though, is to read actively. Highlight wisdom, remark on culture, and challenge the author's ideas when you think they're wrong.</p>
<p>When you make an activity active instead of passive (how reading usually is), your retention increases dramatically and you'll also extract every ounce of wisdom and perspective you can from the time and money you're spending on these books.</p>
<p><em>Note: </em>I don't endorse speed-reading. Vocalization can really help when you're struggling with foreign-sounding language. It can also help you understand the style of the author. Read as fast or as slow as you need.</p>
<p>At the same time, I clearly don't endorse Kindles, libraries, and audiobooks--in order from most tolerance to least. This system <em>can</em> be done with a Kindle, if your lifestyle only allows you to use a Kindle. Libraries <em>can</em> work for at least part of the system (getting passages), just write them on separate sheets of paper. Audiobooks, although very convenient, are simply disrespectful. You've warped a medium of text to a radio program. Good job. (<a title="What I’ve Been Consuming" href="http://www.rmorabia.com/consumption-1/">Yes, I realize I'm reading two series in an audiobook format.</a> I am admitting to disrespecting Lemony Snicket and J.K. Rowling.)</p>
<p>Honestly, just buy the books in a physical format. <a href="http://www.ryanholiday.net/how-to-read-more-a-lot-more/">Here's what Ryan Holiday has to say about that</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">If I had to steal books to support my reading habit, I would. Thankfully you can buy some of the best literature ever published for pennies on Amazon.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But forget money entirely when it comes to books. Reading is not a luxury. It’s not something you splurge on. It’s a necessity.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As Erasmus, the 16th century scholar once put it, “When I get a little money I buy books; and if any is left I buy food and clothes.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">On top of that, books are an investment. I hear from people all the time who tell me they plan to buy this book or that book. Plan? Just buy it. I promised myself a long time ago that if I saw a book that interested me I’d never let time or money or anything else prevent me from having it. Not money, not time, not my own laziness. Don’t wait around for some book you want to read to come out in paperback–trying to save $2 or $3 is the wrong mindset. If it’s a book you’ll read, then read it now, not in a year.</p>
<p dir="ltr">

<h2>Step 3: After You Read the Book</h2>
<p>This is an area I still haven't developed to a degree that I would like. I know there's a lot of potential from the post-reading experience, but I'm still figuring it out.</p>
<p>The most important thing to do after you read the book is to make sure you can access it. Put it on a bookshelf, or in my case, at the top of my closet, always available for reference.</p>
<p>You're going to be citing and referencing these books a lot. You're going to come across problems and realize that this has been solved in a book before, and you're going to need to refresh your memory.</p>
<p>Don't donate them, only lend them to people you trust, and don't let them fade away under the bed or in the basement. Always keep them visible.</p>
<p>Besides, I find it to be a bit of an accomplishment to see the marked-up books every day.</p>
<p>Second, <a href="http://thoughtcatalog.com/ryan-holiday/2013/08/how-and-why-to-keep-a-commonplace-book/">set up a commonplace book</a>. My commonplace book is the book quotes area of this blog, along with using ruled 3x5 index cards. (I'm still establishing how I want to do this.) You can use a notebook, Evernote, or anything you want, really.</p>
<p>Unlike referencing books, your commonplace book is what guides you every single day and with every single decision. This is what you aspire to be, things that inspire you, and advice for every moment. It's your foundation.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>This isn't my conclusive guide on how to read a book. This is just a method I've developed after reading a lot about how other people read books and adjusting to my own situation.</p>
<p>The goal of this post is simply to challenge your own reading habits and to document my method formally.</p>
