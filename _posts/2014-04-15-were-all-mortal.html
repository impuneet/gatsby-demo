<p>What is stopping you from becoming everything you want to be?</p>
<p>The exceptions and the outliers that you admire only became exceptions and outliers because they took the initiative to do so.</p>
<p>Everyone who you admire, and don't admire, is a mortal.</p>
<p>We're all mortal.</p>
<p>Even though some of us are born in a worse place than others, most of the greats you admire have no genetic reason why they became great. It was their own choices and their priorities that led to them changing their part of the world.</p>
<p>They're mortal, just like you.</p>
<p>They're mortal, just like me.</p>
<p>If we're all mortal, then what's stopping you from changing your part of the world?</p>
<p>What is <em>really</em> stopping you from becoming everything you want to be?</p>
<p>Remember, time is passing, regardless of whether or not you're on the right path.</p>
<p>So, get on the right path.</p>
