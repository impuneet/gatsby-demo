<p>Combine two or more sources, and add your own style to it.</p>
<p>Right now, in the age of "information overload," (<a href="http://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2013/06/there-is-no-such-thing-as-information-overload/">which by the way, is a myth</a>) common knowledge is to "Create more and consume less!"</p>
<p>Only with less consumption can your mind be opened up to new possibilities and breakthroughs, right?</p>
<p>Wrong.</p>
<p>How do you think your beloved Apple products were designed? Look at the video below, titled "Everything is a Remix," which cite's Apple's sources and then shows you their own flair.</p>

<p>Nassim Taleb's New York Times Bestseller, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Antifragile-Things-That-Gain-Disorder/dp/0812979680">Antifragile</a>, was criticized as nothing new. It's all been said before.</p>
<p>The unique thing about Antifragile or the iPhone is that they combine unexpected sources and add their own flair to the products.</p>
<p>This is how Antifragile went on to sell so many copies and how the iPhone became as iconic as the iPhone is.</p>
<h2>How do I become original?</h2>
<p>Apple and Nassim Taleb are extraordinary examples, obviously. But how can we, normal people who may just write or film sometimes, be original?</p>
<p>It's the same process. Consume a little bit every day, and keep a notebook of ideas and inspiration for when you need it. I tend to write down post titles, which is usually a question or a How to _____ (like this post!), so it tells me exactly what I need to write when I sit down to write it.</p>
<p>Nothing I write comes from sitting in front of a blank text editor, waiting for inspiration to strike. I always have ideas in the back of my head, so the words just flow. <a href="http://sebastianmarshall.com/three-strategies-for-more-writing-in-less-minutes2">Sebastian Marshall talks about this further.</a></p>
<p>Say you have your sources and you have a nice idea going, but you don't know how to make it your own. What you're creating sounds like an exact distilling of your favorite artist's voice, not your own.</p>
<p>The only way to fix this is to put in the time. The more you create, the more you find your own voice. In the beginning, you tend to emulate the last good thing you saw, because that's how you want to be. That's your good taste, and it's nothing to be ashamed of. Eventually, you'll ease into your own unique style. It took me nearly a year to do so, and I still haven't reached perfection.</p>
<p>Someday, with consistent effort, you will be original, and you'll attract a following for it. There's a lot of noise out there from people who practically remake whatever they like most, but if you combine multiple things you like and add your own flair, you'll very quickly stand out against the rest.</p>
