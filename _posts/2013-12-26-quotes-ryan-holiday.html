<blockquote><ul><li>Don’t expect anyone else to understand. It’s your job to find a release and an outlet for the stress and the feelings. Never forget: the crazy stays at home.</li>
<li>It’s not ambition or skill that is going to set you apart—notice I didn’t mention those things a single time. It’s safe to assume you’ve already got them covered. What will set you apart, what is rare, is humility, diligence and self-awareness.</li>
<li>Make it happen. Nobody cares what it will take, what problems this causes for you, what personal stuff you have going on. Just get it done. You can tell us what you went through…after.</li>  <cite><a href="http://www.ryanholiday.net/advice-to-a-young-man-hoping-to-go-somewhere-or-get-something-from-someone-successful/">Ryan Holiday</a></cite></ul></blockquote>

<blockquote>What I’ve learned–and it’s probably one of the few life lessons I picked up on my own–is that if you continue at the pace you set for yourself, 9 times out of 10 you walk away the winner. I’ve picked up on the fact that success in life begins itself internally and manifests itself externally. And the only way you can reach your destiny is to define and then commit everything to achieving it. <cite><a href="http://www.ryanholiday.net/the-business-of-running/">Ryan Holdiay</a></cite></blockquote>

<blockquote><ul><li>Never recline your seat on an airplane. Yes, it gives you more room–but ultimately at the expense of someone else. In economics, they call this an externality. It’s bad. Don’t do it.</li>
    <li>If someone wants to go faster, let them pass.</li>
    <li>Everything your doctor, school and parents said was healthy is probably bad for you. Whole grains, soy, corn, wraps, milk.</li>
    <li>Unless it’s an atrocity, take responsibility for it. You’re probably more at fault than you know.</li>
    <li>The best way to flirt is to ask provocative questions. And provocative is anything people aren’t expecting to be asked–it doesn’t have to be sexual.</li> <cite><a href="http://www.ryanholiday.net/25-rules-for-living-from-a-semi-successful-26-year-old/">Ryan Holiday</a></cite></ul></blockquote>

<blockquote>On top of that, books are an investment. I hear from people all the time who tell me they plan to buy this book or that book. Plan? Just buy it. I promised myself a long time ago that if I saw a book that interested me I’d never let time or money or anything else prevent me from having it. Not money, not time, not my own laziness. Don’t wait around for some book you want to read to come out in paperback–trying to save $2 or $3 is the wrong mindset. If it’s a book you’ll read, then read it now, not in a year. <cite><a href="http://www.ryanholiday.net/how-to-read-more-a-lot-more/">Ryan Holiday</a></cite></blockquote>

<blockquote>Think of it this way, if there is a general rule or aphorism that lays out your path then it’s probably a common one. And thus it lacks any scarcity or value. <cite><a href="http://www.ryanholiday.net/seriously-you-can-do-whatever-you-want/">Ryan Holiday</a></cite></blockquote>

<blockquote><ul><li>You got to be a miserable Jew. You can’t look at what went right here. You’ve got to look at all of the things that could’ve been a little bit better. You got to be neurotic and obsessed and almost depressed about what you’re working on so you’re constantly refining and refreshing and changing and improving because you’re never satisfied with what you’re doing.</li>
<li>I think the last thing you want to do is put so much on something, that when it doesn’t happen you’re devastated because life is too short to be devastated.</li> <cite><a href="http://www.entrepreneuronfire.com/podcast/ryan-holiday-interview-of-trust-me-im-lying-with-john-lee-dumas-of-entrepreneur-on-fire/">Ryan Holiday</a></cite></ul></blockquote>

<h3>More Notes From the <a href="http://www.entrepreneuronfire.com/podcast/ryan-holiday-interview-of-trust-me-im-lying-with-john-lee-dumas-of-entrepreneur-on-fire/">Above Interview</a>:</h3>
<ul><li>Do things above your level and push to not let anyone down.</li>
	<ul><li>The way to success is strategically along the way of least expectation and tactically along the line of least resistance. <cite>William Tecumseh Sherman</cite></li></ul>
	<li>See things for what they are and don't come in with a lot of damage (pre-education, assumptions).</li>
	<li>Go for the opportunities where you have many little tests and more opportunities to see if your ideas work (more feedback = better)</li>
	<li>External validation is not proof that you made it, you should try to do good work that you stand by and appreciate.</li>
		<ul><li>Put your life on something in your control.</li></ul>
    <li>It takes 10,000 hours to get really good at something, but it takes 20,000 to redefine the game and change the rules.</li>
	<li>Secrets to Success: Work Out (2x) + Reading</li>
	<li>Being hungry is the essence of entrepreneurship.</li>
	<li>Read blogs from people who don't blog for a living.</li>
	<li>Everything scales. The 0 > 1 is the hardest, but then it gets easier to get from 1 > 100, etc.</li></ul>

<blockquote>There is no organization there, just strength of will and purpose. If you know what you want to do, and who you are, it’s easy not to be distracted by your own bullshit. If you have illusions about who you are–that is an inflated sense of it–and are, deep down, averse to hard work, it’s impossible to not be distracted by it. Your fear of failure and your creeping awareness that you are a fraud makes it a certainty–a necessity even–that you detour just enough to prevent ever facing a legitimate opportunity to fail. If you fail, the entire edifice collapses. <cite><a href="http://www.ryanholiday.net/an-interview-with-me/">Ryan Holiday</a></cite></blockquote>
