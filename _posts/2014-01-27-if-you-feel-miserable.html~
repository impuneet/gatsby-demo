<p><em>The post below is adapted from <a href="http://ndoherty.com/sebastian">Niall Doherty's great interview with Sebastian Marshall</a>.<br />

<p><em>A draft of this was first sent to my email list, Uncensored Thoughts. <a title="New List: Uncensored Thoughts" href="http://www.rmorabia.com/thoughts/">Want in?</a></em></p>
<p>Get healthy.</p>
<p>If you feel miserable, ask yourself:</p>
<ol>
<li>Have you drank water?</li>
<li>Have you eaten food?</li>
<li>Have you showered?</li>
<li>Have you spent at least an hour outside?</li>
</ol>
<p>If all of that is fulfilled, then...</p>
<ol>
<li>Have you brushed your teeth?</li>
<li>Have you flossed?</li>
<li>Have you stretched?</li>
<li>Have you done [any other self-care here]?</li>
</ol>
<p>If all of that is fulfilled, then...</p>
<ol>
<li>Have you gone for a walk?</li>
<li>Have you gone for a run/any other moderate-heavy exercise?</li>
<li>Have you socialized with good people?</li>
<li>Have you had an experience (museum, movie, etc.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember, the way out of this misery is not by completing some Herculean achievement. It's by getting your fundamentals in order.</p>
<p>...</p>
