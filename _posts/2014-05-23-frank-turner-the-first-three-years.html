<h2>Rating: 55/100</h2>

<p>(<em><b>Formula for the Rating System</b>: number of tracks I feel emotionally connected to / total number of tracks</em>)</p>

<h2>Album Description:</h2>
<p><b>Artist</b>: Frank Turner<br />
<b>Year</b>: 2008 <br />
<b>Type</b>: Compilation Album</br />
<b>Personal Notes</b>: The First Three Years is basically all the songs that didn't make it on the albums and LPs from Frank Turner's first three years as a solo artist. I usually end up liking compilation albums, covers, and rare songs more than singles and the studio albums.</p>

<h3>Smiling At Strangers on Trains</h3>

<p><div class="box">
	It was the strangest thing today:<br>
	I saw new footprints in abandoned pathways.<br>
	Beneath forgotten undergrowth something stirring again <br>
	You were a single red blood cell but I lost you in this knot of capillaries,<br>
	<b>But you were bringing me oxygen when I needed it most in the smoke.</b><br>
	<br>
	And you were always as far as Mongolia,<br>
	As close as my clothes,<br>
	Your presence pervading,<br>
	But it still never shows.<br>
	<b>As close as the answer I never quite know,<br>
	Or can't quite remember.</b><br>
	Your distance insidious,<br>
	As soft as a blow.<br>
	<b>Your shadow is with me wherever I go.<br>
	It's on the tip of my tongue but still I never quite know,<br>
	Or can't quite remember.</b><br>
	I don't quite remember.<br>
	<br>
	The forced proximity of a million different Mike Leigh movies<br>
	Makes me long for the fresh air of a familiar face,<br>
	<b>And not the violence of loneliness,</b><br>
	Nor the unease of surrounded seclusion.<br>
	<b>I keep nearly missing you around corners and in passing trains.<br>
	<br>
	And if I'd known that you weren't so far away,<br>
	That you were never that far away,<br>
	I could've rode this train smiling.</b>

<h4>Thoughts:</h4>

<p>This song is a cover of the first single from Frank Turner's old band, Million Dead. That band was post-hardcore. I heard the original, and I frankly don't like it as much--I found that the vocals got buried underneath the instruments, while in Frank Turner's stuff, his voice is the the most prevalent instrument and always acts as the melody.</p>
<p>It's interesting how complicated these lyrics are compared to Frank's new stuff. I remember reading an interview that Frank was focusing on simple lyrics and easily getting the meaning across rather than the complicated lyrics of Million Dead. I find it harder to connect emotionally with this song, because I don't know what the point is up until the last minute. It took a long time to warm up to it.</p>
<p>I often listen to this song straight for hours upon hours. The rhythm of the song, both with the flow of the vocals and the guitar/drums that make up the harmony have my absolutely obsessed.</p>
<p>Frank Turner songs are like a symphony in 5 minutes. A common theme is this this build-up through the song until the last minute is like this rush of emotion and harmony. Once it ends, it's not enough--so I repeat it again and again and again. I only stop when I get interrupted.</p>
