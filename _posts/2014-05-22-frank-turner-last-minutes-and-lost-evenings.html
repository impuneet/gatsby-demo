<h3>I Knew Prufrock Before He Got Famous</h3>

<p><div class="box">
Let's begin at the beginning: we're lovers and we're losers,<br>
We're heroes and we're pioneers, and we're beggars and we're choosers.<br>
We're skirting round the edges of the ideal demographic.<br>
We're almost on the guestlist, but we're always stuck in traffic.<br>
We've watched our close associates up and play their parts;<br>
They're chatting up the it girls, and they're tearing up the charts,<br>
While we were paying with coppers to get our round in at the bar.<br>
We're the C-Team, we're the almost famous old friends of the stars.<br>
<br>
Justin is the last of the great romantic poets,<br>
And he's the only one among us who is ever going to make it.<br>
We planned a revolution from a cheap Southampton bistro;<br>
I don't remember details but there were English boys with banjos.<br>
Jay is our St George, and he's standing on a wooden chair,<br>
And he sings songs and he slays dragons, and he's losing all his hair.<br>
Adam is the resurrected spirit of Gram Parsons,<br>
In plaid instead of rhinestone and living in South London.<br>
And no one's really clear about Tommy's job description,<br>
But it's pretty clear he's vital to the whole damn operation.<br>
Dave Danger smiles at strangers, Tre's the safest girl I know,<br>
Zo and Harps will skamper up to victory in the city we call home.<br>
<br>
We won't change our ways, we will proud remain when the glory fades.<br>
<br>
I am sick and tired of people who are living on the B-list.<br>
They're waiting to be famous and they're wondering why they do this.<br>
And I know I'm not the one who is habitually optimistic,<br>
But I'm the one who's got the microphone here so just remember this:<br>
<br>
Life is about love, last minutes and lost evenings,<br>
About fire in our bellies and furtive little feelings,<br>
And the aching amplitudes that set our needles all a-flickering,<br>
And help us with remembering that the only thing that's left to do is live.<br>
<br>
After all the loving and the losing, the heroes and the pioneers,<br>
the only thing that's left to do is get another round in at the bar.
