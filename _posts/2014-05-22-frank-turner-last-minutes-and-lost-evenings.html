<h3>I Knew Prufrock Before He Got Famous</h3>

<p><div class="box">
Let's begin at the beginning: we're lovers and we're losers,<br>
We're heroes and we're pioneers, and we're beggars and we're choosers.<br>
We're skirting round the edges of the ideal demographic.<br>
We're almost on the guestlist, but we're always stuck in traffic.<br>
We've watched our close associates up and play their parts;<br>
They're chatting up the it girls, and they're tearing up the charts,<br>
While we were paying with coppers to get our round in at the bar.<br>
We're the C-Team, we're the almost famous old friends of the stars.<br>
<br>
Justin is the last of the great romantic poets,<br>
And he's the only one among us who is ever going to make it.<br>
We planned a revolution from a cheap Southampton bistro;<br>
I don't remember details but there were English boys with banjos.<br>
Jay is our St George, and he's standing on a wooden chair,<br>
And he sings songs and he slays dragons, and he's losing all his hair.<br>
Adam is the resurrected spirit of Gram Parsons,<br>
In plaid instead of rhinestone and living in South London.<br>
And no one's really clear about Tommy's job description,<br>
But it's pretty clear he's vital to the whole damn operation.<br>
Dave Danger smiles at strangers, Tre's the safest girl I know,<br>
Zo and Harps will skamper up to victory in the city we call home.<br>
<br>
We won't change our ways, we will proud remain when the glory fades.<br>
<br>
I am sick and tired of people who are living on the B-list.<br>
They're waiting to be famous and they're wondering why they do this.<br>
And I know I'm not the one who is habitually optimistic,<br>
But I'm the one who's got the microphone here so just remember this:<br>
<br>
<b></b>Life is about love, last minutes and lost evenings,<br>
About fire in our bellies and furtive little feelings,</b><br>
And the aching amplitudes that set our needles all a-flickering,<br>
And help us with remembering that <b>the only thing that's left to do is live.</b><br>
<br>
After all the loving and the losing, the heroes and the pioneers,<br>
<b>the only thing that's left to do is get another round in at the bar.</b>
</div></p>

<h4>Thoughts:</h4>

<p>The track begins pretty mediocre, and this is a constant in some Frank Turner songs. If you don't give it time, you won't reach the best part, which is around the last minute. It's almost like it escalates, which is kind of odd in a 4-minute esong. I don't think most listeners would have the patience for that, and judgements are usually made so quickly.</p>

<p>The last minute is glorious, and so worth the waiting from the first two minutes. The strings come in and the whole song just feels fuller. Then, you hear the album title, and you know it's serious now.</p>

<h3>I Still Believe</h3>

<p><div class="box">
Hear ye, hear ye, friends and Romans, countrymen.<br>
Hear ye, hear ye, punks and skins and journeymen.<br>
Hear ye, hear ye, my sisters and my brethren.<br>
The time is coming near.<br>
<br>
Come ye, come ye, to soulless corporate circus tops.<br>
Come ye, come ye, to toilet circuit touring stops.<br>
Come ye, come ye, to bedrooms, bars and bunker squats.<br>
The sound is ringing clear.<br>
<br>
Now who'd have thought that after all,<br>
Something as simple as rock 'n' roll would save us all.<br>
And who'd have thought that after all, it was rock 'n' roll.<br>
<br>
Hear ye, hear ye, now anybody could take this stage.<br>
<b>Hear ye, hear ye, and make miracles for minimum wage.</b><br>
Hear ye, hear ye, these folk songs for the modern age<br>
Will hold us in their arms.<br>
<br>
<b>Right here, right now, Elvis brings his children home.<br>
Right here, right now, you never have to feel alone.</b><br>
Right here, right now, teenage kicks and gramophones,<br>
We hold them in our hearts.<br>
<br>
And I still believe in the saints,<br>
Yeah, in Jerry Lee and in Johnny and all the greats.<br>
And I still believe in the sound<br>
That has the power to raise a temple and tear it down.<br>
And I still believe in the need<br>
For guitars and drums and desperate poetry.<br>
And I still believe that everyone<br>
Can find a song for every time they've lost, and every time they've won.<br>
<b>So just remember folks we not just saving lives, we're saving souls,</b><br>
And we're having fun.<br>
<br>
Now who'd have thought that after all,<br>
Something so simple, something so small...<br>
Who'd have thought that after all it's rock 'n' roll?
</div></p>

<h4>Thoughts:</h4>

<p>I find this track to be hopeful. The story behind the song is after Frank went to China and did successful shows there, he realized that rock is everywhere and beyond that, rock is adored everywhere. It's a pleasant listen with a very happy and upbeat melody.</p>
