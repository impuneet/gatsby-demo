<p>A year ago, I was sitting at this computer, in my pajamas and in a very uncomfortable chair, scrambling to finish the work that was assigned to me the week before.</p>

<p>I was at a public online school instead of my local high school for health reasons. That semester was the most difficult experience I'd ever gone through. Granted, I'm sixteen, and I haven't lived through a lot of experiences, but I've lived through more than I'd hoped to by this time in my life.</p>

<p>I was anxious, lonely, tired, depressed, and very, very stressed. I wasn't taking anything too difficult, &nbsp;but it just wasn't working.</p>

<p>When I was younger, I'd always dreamed of going to online school, as it would give me time to either learn cool things or to play video games (it depended on how I felt that day). But now, here I was, fulfilling the dream of having no schedule, and it was hell.</p>

<p>Let me outline my problems with online school:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Environment</strong>.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>The learning "environment" wasn't an environment at all. It was a closed system, required adults for nearly everything, it wasn't responsive, and they didn't even let me start my own club. Lots of times, emails went unanswered, because I guess what I was asking for was too complicated. Many other times, I would do the work and upon submission, all the answers would come up blank. No re-takes allowed, guys!</li>
	<li><strong>No Teaching</strong>.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>The school used a statewide (or maybe even nationwide) lesson plan for each class. This included a cute, little flash video that used clip art. Teachers had one hour a week (not alone!) to "teach," but when the standardized system was going through one section a day, how were they supposed to keep up?</li>
	<li><strong>Workload</strong>. I had to fulfill "classwork" and "homework" for every class. If I worked 8 hours a day, I couldn't fulfill it to the extent they asked for. Along with this, I had no...</li>
	<li><strong>Access to Help</strong>.&nbsp;I had teachers (and I use that term loosely), and all I got from them was access to a one-hour-a-week lecture and email/phone help within the "normal" school hours. (Some of my teachers were on the east coast, which means I couldn't call them after 1pm my time). I also had "peers," but the environment never encouraged any student interaction.</li>
</ul>

<p>All of the above was the online school's fault. It was a cycle of "10 overdue lessons!" The environment fed my lack of being taught, which they tried to make up with the workload, which was so overwhelming, I needed help, which I couldn't get, because of the environment.</p>

<p>I got through that by cheating and begging teachers to drop lessons.</p>

<p>But some of it was my fault, too. A lot of people work online these days. You wake up early, at 6AM, like I did, but suddenly, it's 9PM, and you got 2 tasks/lessons done (out of 6 given daily, not even counting the ones I was behind on). Maybe you'll identify with some of my mistakes.</p>

<h1>What I Did Wrong</h1>
<ul>
	<li><strong><a href="http://www.rmorabia.com/focus/">Didn't focus</a></strong>.&nbsp;The post on focus is a culmination of over a year of hard work, thinking, and huge possibilities for failure. Before I ever used said methods, I simply logged onto the interface (it's a bit like cPanel), opened up the easiest lesson, and said "I'm going to get stuff done today."<strong>
</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Got distracted</strong>. Lifehacker, blogs, The Atlantic, FastCompany, and tons of other junk filled Google Reader and my tabs. I also owned a Kindle at this time, and would constantly struggle between reading Project Gutenberg books or the free Indie deals that were much less of a struggle to get through. I got through nearly one book a day at this time, and thought I was smart for it. (more on why I would never recommend getting a Kindle and my reading habits in an upcoming post)</li>
	<li><strong>Didn't question my working environment</strong>. I had a desk and a chair that were very uncomfortable, and <em>so</em> close to my bed. I often plopped over there and napped while the clip art lessons played. Also, the reasons I had to go to online school were just getting worse with this environment (physically, don't even get me started on the mental problems involved).</li>
	<li><strong>Didn't meet people</strong>. I lost all my friends when I didn't see any of them for 9 months (with the exception of a 6-week sabbatical into summer school, which were actually my happiest and healthiest 6 weeks of that year) Sure, there's texting, IMing, etc., but topics would fade quickly because now I was irrelevant.</li>
	<li><strong>No sunlight/exercise</strong>. I was so busy with my workload, I never had time to go outside. When I did (on my hipster bike!), I was the happiest. It wasn't a priority, though, because I was so behind.</li>
</ul>

<p>I was miserable. Even now, I feel anxiety and fear from those 9 months. I didn't learn any Pre-Calculus, will I pass Calculus this year? All of the people around me have 9 months more than me to get close and to establish a group of friends, what if I find none? I still struggle with some of the consequences of that time, but I also developed from those failures.</p>

<p>I developed the self-confidence to put my ideas and opinions out there. I learned how to think and gauge value (the most underrated skill in history). I learned how to write for an online audience (<a href="http://www.quora.com/Radhika-Morabia/answers">see the development here</a>). I learned the truth behind productivity and work. I fixed my diet and figured out exactly what makes me procrastinate (Have you developed the answer to that question?).</p>

<p>Note, this wasn't a rapid process. This took nearly a year, but now I can say, with narcissism, that I have advanced far beyond many of my peers (even the ones that are often praised for their aptitude).</p>

<h1>How to Develop Yourself</h1>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Learn how to think</strong>. This is the hardest, but the most important thing I have ever done. It's really hard to teach, so many people don't talk about it, but it's impacted every aspect of my life. From consumption to creation, this is how to make your growth and impact exponential. I may write a post in the future about this, but for now, check out my favorite blog on thinking: <a href="http://farnamstreetblog.com/">Farnam Street</a>. Trust me, Shane's work is awesome.</li>
	<li><strong>Think before you speak</strong>. I use this in a different connotation than the norm. Once you learn how to think, make sure you think about the opinions and the words you're saying before you say them. From the above blog, see <a href="http://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2013/04/the-work-required-to-have-an-opinion/">The Work Required to Have an Opinion</a>.</li>
	<li><strong>Define your values</strong>. Define what you want out of your relationships, your working life, your health, your music, everything. This cuts out the anxiety behind all of your actions and makes it very easy to cut out things that don't help you. For example, this post is currently over 1000 words long. If I didn't already know that I want to go into all the detail I can pack into one post and that I want my audience to be the types of people who value this detail and the lack of a quick fix, I would've felt insecure about the word count. However, this is being published, and I have no regrets about it. The best way to develop a value system is to constantly expose yourself to other people's values (direct and indirect, indirect being trying to identify values through their actions) and see if their way works better in your situation. <a href="http://thirteenvirtues.com">Start with Ben Franklin's.</a></li>
	<li><strong>Become meticulously self-aware</strong>. I mentioned above that I know exactly why I procrastinate. From the traffic "How to Stop Procrastinating" articles still get, it's obvious that not everyone has developed this. I know why I procrastinate because I am aware of myself to an extent that most people fear. The best way to do this is that when you catch yourself doing something without knowing why, ask yourself why.</li>
	<li><strong>Record everything</strong>. I have various notebooks and files for various reasons. One is for summarizing what I learn into actionable steps, another's for long-form journaling or drafts of the articles on this blog. I've also archived my daily task lists from the Task-Based Pomodoro Technique, and have index cards of quotes that have impacted me. Writing things down helps you find patterns over the long-term, and especially helps you not give in to cognitive biases. There's plenty online about how to best record specific things, so I'll leave you to search accordingly. If you want my help, leave a comment or <a href="mailto:rmorabia@hush.com">email me</a> and I will point you in the right direction.</li>
	<li><strong>Take yourself seriously</strong>. My biggest takeaway from reading Ben Franklin's autobiography was that I, too, can accomplish at least half of what Ben did, as long as I persevere with focus. No one is better than you, and if they are, it's only because of the deliberate actions they took. This means that you don't have to suck up to people or do things because you feel obligated to. It's your life, and it's seriously yours. Not your parents' life, not your significant other's life, not your friends' life. It's yours, and it's your choice what you do with it.</li>
	<li><strong>Take people seriously</strong>. No one's better than you, but if someone is giving you thought-out advice, support, or even a book recommendation without any direct benefit to themselves, take it seriously. More than the circle-jerk of bloggers who are all getting paid to recommend you this book or course, value legitimate time taken for possibly no return.</li>
	<li><strong>Find idols</strong>. I have a page in a journal of the names of the people I admire. Some are alive, some are dead. Some are names recognized all around the world, and some have online followings of less than a thousand people. Make sure you have access to their failures, successes, and thoughts. Biographies of the dead, contact information of the living, and RSS feeds of the inaccessible living are my favorite tools.</li>
	<li><strong>Fake it till you make it</strong>. I'm definitely not interesting enough or old enough to start a blog and write here without anyone asking me to. Yet, here I am. Hopefully, there will come a point where people find it natural to come to my site, read my posts, and follow me on my journey. If I waited until that point where I've done something interesting enough to warrant my writing, I would be losing out on valuable time to develop an audience, network, and voice. (Note: This doesn't mean put up trash on the internet!)</li>
	<li><strong>Accept failure</strong>. The school system makes people cripple at the thought of failure. Even small failures, like a rejected favor, kills people inside. Get over it and move on. Life isn't over yet, thank the unknown overlords.</li>
	<li><strong>Constantly push yourself</strong>. Talk to people you're scared of, be vulnerable to an unknown audience, or finally put an idea out at a meeting. Staying hostile is easier because there's no chance of failure (except the regret you feel when you go to sleep at night). Always try to fight against it.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a lot for one post. It may have been better to expand upon each point I address in several posts, but this is the end product I am going with.</p>

<p>I genuinely hope this helps you, and thank you for reading (or skimming through) these 2000 words.</p>
