summary: I missed out on a lot during my 6 weeks away, but I now have the unique advantage of putting the lessons I learned into action to accelerate me even further.

It's practically been 2 months since I last spoke to you.

Honestly, I'm not sorry.

I got horribly sick just days after shipping my newest blog redesign.

Then, I was in bedrest for 6 whole weeks. Seriously.

What happened? I still don't know, honestly. I just suddenly began getting diarrhea and tummy aches after every meal, and I wasn't able to keep any food in. Without food, I had no energy, so I loafed around in my room avoiding my responsibilities.

Before I got sick, I was building up a bunch of assets. All my hard work was starting to pay off. I snagged some mentorships, I relaunched the blog, and I began freelancing with huge success, making a full-time income within my first month.

But then, it all stopped. I didn't have the energy to keep up with my priorities when I was so sick, and I fell entirely off the map. I stopped checking email, I stopped reading, and I even stopped listening to music. With the exception of watching bad TV shows, I practically had no exposure to the outside world.

I was isolated for 6 weeks, but I learned a lot from it. Sound familiar? [I went through something similar for back in 2012, and grew leaps and bounds.](http://rmorabia.com/self-development)

Luckily, this time, I've been able to distill 6 lessons from 6 weeks rather than 9 months and too many lessons to handle.

In the online world, 6 weeks is practically forever. I've missed out on a lot, but I've successfully caught up and I'm back in action. I now have the unique advantage of putting the lessons I learned into place to accelerate me even further.

##Lesson #1: Remember your values.

At just 17 years old and with no real connections, I was on track to making $5000 a month by January of 2015.

That's impressive, right?

But, it wasn't aligned to my values. The point of money for me is to give me the freedom to pursue growth. However, I was working all day and neglecting all forms of growth that I had outlined as important. I wanted a cushion of money--then I would pursue growth.

I couldn't wait to go to a family dinner and say, "Yeah, I run a business. I'm grossing around $5000 a month." Then, I would nod as if it was no big deal.

I sacrificed my values to pursue such a high amount, though. I wasn't focused on growth. I felt pseudo. I took on too many clients and I would eventually burn out if I hadn't been stopped by my sickness.

Now, a big part of my day is asking myself if I'm pursuing my values with the work I want to complete every day.

Is the work I'm doing today allowing me to be more free and independent?

Am I approaching my work with integrity and honesty?

Am I adding value to people with the work I am doing?

Will the work I am doing help me in the long run (5+ years)?

I actually do this on paper as a part of my morning routine. I just started doing a morning routine very recently, and if it is a success, expect to hear about it in a few weeks.

##Lesson #2: Growth first.

The work I was doing had logarithmic gains. That means that it would work extremely well in the short run. I would make a ton of money for a few months, but then I'd burn out. I was trying to build up a cushion of money to

At just 17, I can't claim to be an expert in anything. The only real cushion I have is my skills, my network, and my energy.

Because I was only focused on one thing, I wasn't learning any skills and I was neglecting my network. Obviously, burnout means all your energy is burned, as well.

I was making more money than I'd ever need in the short run, but neglecting the three things that will give me millions in the long run: my skills, my network, and my health.

It's fine to be thrifty live off of my bare minimum because I'm so young. But, when my business would eventually burn up in flames, I'd have nothing left for the long run.

##Lesson #3: Pursue distributed income.

Once I dropped off the map, I didn't make a single dollar.

My entire life was dependent on that single source of income. Sure, there were multiple clients, which made it a bit safer if one of them fired me, but if something like the sickness sabotaged the whole business, I would make nothing.

This is why I'm beginning to focus more on distributed sources of income.

Pursuing distributed income doesn't necessarily mean I have to build up passive income streams or distribute the income I make equally. It just means some money should be coming from something other than your main gig.

If your main gig drops, what's left?

Even if a side gig is making very little, nowhere near enough to live off of, it's something. Once you have a side gig built up to even $100 a month, could you possibly invest more time and build it up to become your new main gig? $0 to $100 is much harder to reach than $100 to $1000.

Then, if that main gig drops, you should have other side gigs to go for.

Having distributed income sources builds resilience and freedom. Those are values that are very important to me, so I'm taking a proactive approach to building a distributed income. Hopefully, you'll be seeing some of the results from that in the very near future.

##Lesson #4: Always be analyzing.

If I had been analyzing my work, my priorities, my values, and my feelings every day, I would've never fallen into the trap of workaholicism and the endless pursuit of money.

I was actively ignoring my sub-conscious because it never came to fruition.

My idiocy seems to shine right through when I'm voicing it to someone (not through email, but either a real face-to-face meeting or a phone call) or when I'm writing it down on paper.

But, since I had no priority in analysis, talking to people, and reflection, I was able to delude myself to continue working for weeks, when I knew the system I had set up wasn't working. If the sickness hadn't come, it may have even been months before I finally stepped back and analyzed my business in accordance with my life.

It's so easy to delude yourself for days, months, or even years. It's in every stereotypical inspirational film. There's a character who wants to be an artist, but he's working a sales job at an evil company with a rude boss. He does no form of analysis, and only when something comes and hits him in the face (getting fired, or in my case, getting sick) does he finally step back and pursue his real dreams.

The quick fix is to analyze and journal every day, or to prioritize talking to people who will call you out when you're not in accordance with your values.

I'm trying to analyze 7 days a week. I've set up a morning and evening analysis template. (Again, if this goes well, you'll be hearing details in a few weeks.)

I'm also pursuing getting on the phone with people five times a week to flesh out my ideas and to keep in touch in a more fluid way than email updates. (By the way, would you be interested in talking to me on the phone or on Skype? [Schedule a call with me.](http://rmorabia.youcanbook.me) I'd really love to talk to you, even if we've never spoken before.)

I'm using these constant reminders to keep me in check. I hope to never fall into such a bout of denial and pseudo-progress again. If I do, though, I'm hoping the people I let in and the analysis I do bounce me back to reality very quickly.

So far, it's worked well.

##Lesson #5: Pursue directions, not goals.

I don't like goals very much. There are a few issues I have:

* Most goals are towards a conclusion that you actually have no control over. (eg. Make $1000 a month.)
* Goals don't have a very clearly defined why.
* Goals seem to have very little context into the bigger picture.

Here's my alternative... Pursue directions.

You're on a path right now. Every moment, you're faced with an unlimited number of directions in which to go.

You can't just plug in the end goal on the GPS, because **you honestly have no idea what the end is**.

So, with every decision about which path to pursue, ask yourself if this is the direction you'd like to go in.

For example, you're offered a great corporate job--more pay, more benefits, great working environment. But, you'd have to move to San Francisco.

Is that a direction you'd like to pursue? You have no clue where staying in your current job or going to SF will take you in the end, but which direction is more aligned with your values?

When you quit goals, you're a failure. When you shift your direction, that's all it is. It's just a tiny little shift.

This is a subtle change that has honestly allowed me to grow much more than goals ever did. I've been thinking a lot about other subtle mindset shifts, so look forward to hearing more about that in the future.

##Lesson #6: Generosity opens opportunities.

I was brought up to think, "Don't share too much," "Don't be too open," etc..

However, every opportunity that has opened up for me in the past year has been because of generosity.

I share my ideas here on the blog, and I've met the most amazing people because of it.

I share my time and energy in my mentorships, and I've been taught so much.

I share my process with my clients, and they respect me for being thorough and keeping them in the know.

I still get scared.

What if someone turns around and steals from me? What if this is a scam? What if I'm left in the dust?

It's going to happen, eventually. I know it is. But, I'm not going to let the fear of being scammed once keep me from going after the 99 opportunities that generosity opens up for me.

Honesty and openness are still some of the most interesting and respected traits in this world. People are attracted to it and give their time and money to people who flaunt their honesty and openness.

Sure, those people get scammed sometimes, but being honest and open doesn't mean sacrificing yourself for other people. [Be selfish, remember?](http://rmorabia.com/17)
