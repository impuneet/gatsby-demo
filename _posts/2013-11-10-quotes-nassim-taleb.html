    <li>If you have something very important to say, whisper it.</li>
    <li>The ultimate freedom lies in not having to explain “why” you did something.
    A book that can be summarized should not be written as a book.</li></ul> <cite><a href="http://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2013/08/34-insights-from-nassim-taleb/">Nassim Taleb</cite></blockquote>

<blockquote><ul><li>It’s his “fuck you” money that allows him to do exactly what he wants, when he wants, beholden to no one.</li>
