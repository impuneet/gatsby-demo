<blockquote>Success is about honour, feeling morally calibrated, absence of shame, not what some newspaper defines from an external metric. <cite><a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/d538a45a-4871-11e2-a1c0-00144feab49a.html#axzz2Z2Yg5a6H">Nassim Taleb</a></cite></blockquote>

<blockquote>A trivial and potent heuristic to figure out success: a) you are absolutely successful if and only if you don’t envy anyone; b) quite successful if those you envy you don’t know in person; c) miserably unsuccessful if those you envy you encounter or think about daily.

<p>Absolute success is mostly found among ascetic persons. <cite><a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=10151084948833375&amp;id=13012333374">Nassim Taleb</a></cite></p></blockquote>
