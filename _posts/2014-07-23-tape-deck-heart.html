<h2>Rating: 44/100</h2>

<h2>Album Description</h2>
<p><b>Artist</b>: Frank Turner<br />
<b>Year</b>: 2013<br />
<b>Type<b>: Studio Album<br />
<b>Personal Notes</b>: Tape Deck Heart is the first album of Frank Turner's that I owned. A year after first hearing Frank on NPR's Tiny Desk Concerts and now owning every album and EP, it's honestly the worst work of Frank Turner's, but it was also the most commercially successful, reaching #2 in the UK and #52 in the US. It introduced me to the magic that is Frank Turner, so I can't give it too much flak. As a whole, it doesn't feel as emotional or symphonic as the other albums, but the tracks that are good are extraordinary.</p>

<h3>Recovery</h3>

<p><div class="box">
	Blacking in and out in a strange flat in East London,<br>
	<b>Somebody I don't really know just gave me something<br>
	To help settle me down and to stop me always thinking about you.</b><br>
	And you know your life is heading in a questionable direction<br>
	<b>When you're up for days with strangers and you can't remember anything<br>
	Except the way you sounded when you told me you didn't know what I should do.</b><br>
	<br>
	It's a long road up to recovery from here, a long way back to the light.<br>
	A long road up to recovery from here, a long way to making it right.<br>
	<br>
	I've been waking in the morning just like every other day,<br>
	<b>And just like every boring blues song I get swallowed by the pain,<br>
	And so I fumble for your figure in the darkness just to make it go away.</b><br>
	But you're not lying there any longer, and I know that that's my fault,<br>
	<b>So I've been pounding on the floor and I've been crawling up the walls,<br>
	And I've been dipping in my darkness for serotonin boosters, cider and some kind of smelling salts.</b><br>
	<br>
	<b>On the first night we met you said "well darling, let's make a deal:<br>
	If anybody ever asks us, let's tell them that we met in jail."</b><br>
	And that's the story that I'm sticking to like a stony-faced accomplice,<br>
	<b>But today I need to hear some truth if I'm ever getting through this.<br>
	You once sent me a letter that said "if you're lost at sea,<br>
	Close your eyes and catch the tide my dear and only think of me."<br>
	Well darling now I'm sinking, I'm as lost as lost can be,<br>
	And I was hoping you could drag me up from down here towards my recovery.<br>
	<br>
	If you could just give me a sign, just a subtle little glimmer,<br>
	Some suggestion that you'd have me if I could only make me better,<br>
	Then I would stand a little stronger as I walk a little taller all the time.<br>
	Because I know you are a cynic but I think I can convince you,<br>
	Because broken people can get better if they really want to,<br>
	Or at least that's what I have to tell myself if I am hoping to survive.<br>
	<br>
	Darling, sweet lover, won't you help me to recover.<br>
	Darling, sweet lover, one day this will all be over.</b>

<h4>Thoughts:</h4>

<p>This was the first song that Frank Turner and Matt Nasir (on the mandolin) played in the <a href="http://www.npr.org/event/music/198794929/frank-turner-tiny-desk-concert">NPR Tiny Desk Concert</a>, and honestly, who can resist a good break-up song?</p>

<p>It's energetic while being sentimental. It makes you want to dance while being a break-up song. Although this track isn't as symphonic as Frank Turner's best, there's still a climax that leaves you breathless. It's just a bit too pop to really be the usual acoustic rock symphony.</p>

<p>But, this was the first song I heard, and it had me hooked. I can't say it's my favorite song, but I can't say it's not good. It's great. The lyrics in particular are so memorable and quotable, and this song would probably win if this was a purely lyrical review.</p>

<h3>Tell Tale Signs</h3>

<p><div class="box">
	<b>God dammit Amy, we're not kids any more.<br>
	You can't just keep waltzing out of my life, <br>
	Leaving clothes on my bedroom floor,<br>
	Like nothing really matters, like pain doesn't hurt.<br>
	You should mean more to me by now than just heartbreak in a short skirt.<br>
	<br>
	You kind of remind me of scars on my arms that I made when I was a kid,<br>
	With a disassembled disposable razor I stole from my dad,<br>
	When I thought that suffering was something profound,<br>
	That weighed down on wise heads,<br>
	And not just something to be avoided,<br>
	Something normal people dread.<br>
	<br>
	God dammit Amy, well of course I've changed.<br>
	With all the things I've done and the places I've been,<br>
	I'd be a machine if I had stayed the same.<br>
	You're still back where we started, you haven't changed at all.<br>
	You're still trying to live like a kid, like you could always have it all.</b><br>
	<br>
	You know you kind of remind me of scars on my arms that I hid as best I could,<br>
	That I covered with ink, but in the right kind of light they still bleed through,<br>
	<b>Showing that there are some things I just can't change no matter what I do:<br>
	The tell-tale signs of being used,<br>
	Of being trapped inside of you.<br>
	<br>
	You're a beautiful butterfly<br>
	Burned with a branding iron<br>
	Onto my outsides into my insides<br>
	As a simple sign:<br>
	To show off your ownership.<br>
	Burned into my naked skin,<br>
	Onto my outsides into my insides.<br>
	<br>
	It's not even love any more,<br>
	It's just a claim upon my soul.<br>
	It stains my skin, yeah it's on my breath,<br>
	And I'm ashamed to get undressed<br>
	In front of strangers in case they see<br>
	The tell tale signs that you have left all over me.<br>
	<br>
	God dammit Amy.<br>
	You'll always remind me of scars on my arms that I know will never fade.<br>
	And it's not like it's something I think about each and every day -<br>
	I just occasionally catch myself scratching at them, as if they'd ever go away.<br>
	But these tell tale signs are here to stay, and in the end you know that's okay.<br>
	You will always be a part of my patched-up patchwork taped-up tape-deck heart.</b>
</div></p>

<h4>Thoughts:</h4>

<p>What's extraordinary about Frank Turner is how each track manages to be a symphony with crescendos and layers on layers while still being so simple. All we have in this song is Frank's voice as melody, the guitar as harmony, and drums to get the beat down.</p>

<p>The lyrics and the meaning of this song are also so simple, Frank isn't trying to impress you with how poetic he is. With Tell Tale Signs, Rich Costey, the producer, made Frank sing it 42 times to get the perfect fatigued, raw tone we now hear.</p>

<p>This song is absolute genius and I often come back to this song feeling extremely emotional. It's now been a year since I first heard this track, but it's a timeless track that's brimming with feelings.</p>

<h3>Four Simple Words</h3>

<p><div class="box">
	Because we're all so very twenty first century,<br>
	You're probably listening to me on some kind of portable stereo.<br>
	Maybe you're sitting on the back of the bus,<br>
	Or it's running up your sleeve, and you're across from your boss,<br>
	Or you're sitting in your bedroom on your own with the lights down low.<br>
	I'd like to teach you four simple words, so that next time you come to a show,<br>
	You could sing those words back at me like they're the only ones that you know:<br>
	<br>
	<b>I want to dance, I want to dance<br>
	I want lust and love and a smattering of romance.<br>
	But I'm no good at dancing, yet I have to do something.<br>
	Tonight I'm going to play it straight, I'm going to take my chance, I want to dance.</b><br>
	<br>
	Hi ho hi ho hi ho, we're heading out to the punk rock show.<br>
	Colleagues and friends condescend with a smile,<br>
	But this is my culture man, this is my home.<br>
	The dark huddled masses gather at the gate,<br>
	The doors are at 7, the show starts at 8.<br>
	A few precious hours in a space of our own,<br>
	And when the band comes on, the only thing I really know:<br>
	<br>
	Is anybody else sick of the music<br>
	Churned out by lackluster scenesters from Shoreditch?<br>
	Yeah it's all sex drugs and sins, like they're extras from Skins,<br>
	But it's okay because they don't really mean it.<br>
	<b>I want bands who had to work for their keep,<br>
	Drove a thousand miles and played a show on no sleep,<br>
	Sleeping on the floor in a stranger's place,<br>
	Hungry just to do it all again the next day.</b><br>
	<br>
	Put your hands on your hips, bring your knees in tight.<br>
	<b>Yeah we do this shit together man, no fists, no fights.<br>
	We're not trying to shape the world so people think like us,<br>
	We just want our own space to dance, no favors no fuss.</b><br>
	On blood sweat and vinyl we have a built ourselves a house,<br>
	So if the roof is on fire then we're going to put it out.<br>
	Forget about the bitching and remember that you're blessed,<br>
	Because punk is for the kids who never fit in with the rest.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Somebody told me that music with guitars<br>
	was going out of fashion, and I had to laugh.<br>
	This shit wasn't fashionable back when I fell in love,<br>
	So if the hipsters move on why should I give a fuck?</b><br>
	<br>
	I want to dance, I want to dance, <br>
	I want you and me both to join hands down at the front.<br>
	<b>So the next time I see you, remember these words so<br>
	We'll sing like the barricades are down, and we'll dance like no one's around,<br>
	Singing four simple words.</b>
</div></p>

<h4>Thoughts</h4>

<p>Four Simple Words is the perfect example of a Frank Turner symphony. It starts so innocent, so sweet, and you don't expect it to go where it goes. Then, at 1 minute and 22 seconds, the entire game changes. The intensity ramps up to a level that should've made the transition steep and awkward, but instead, it's smooth and gives me shivers each time I hear it. This song manages to pump me up better than any other Frank Turner song.</p>

<p>This song's lyrics and flow are really congruent with the Frank Turner philosophy, so if anyone wants to get into Frank's music, I'd say start with this song (and this album in general). If you like it, dive backwards. See how far it takes you.</p>
