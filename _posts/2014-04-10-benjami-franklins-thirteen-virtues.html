<p>Ben Franklin is famous for creating his thirteen virtues, which he hoped to use to have a bulletproof morality. He compiled other moral rules, from religions and other books, and ultimately came up with his thirteen virtues.</p>
<p>They're very strict, and although you may not agree with them all (I certainly don't), they're worth contemplating. Look at how far they got Benjamin Franklin in life.</p>
<p>The goal was to “use rather more names, with fewer ideas annex'd to each, than a few names with more ideas.” The virtues are as follows, along with my own interpretation of the rules:</p>
<h2>1. Temperance</h2>
<ul>
<li>When eating, stop before the food's taste becomes dull.</li>
<li>When drinking, stop before there's no more room.</li>
</ul>
<h2>2. Silence</h2>
<ul>
<li>Don't speak unless it is beneficial to yourself or others.</li>
<li>Avoid petty arguments.</li>
</ul>
<h2>3. Order</h2>
<ul>
<li>Make sure each of your possessions has its place.</li>
<li>Make sure each part of your business (work, taxes, getting the mail, etc.) has time to get completed.</li>
</ul>
<h2>4. Resolution</h2>
<ul>
<li>Plan to complete what you are responsible for.</li>
<li>Complete what you are responsible for.</li>
</ul>
<h2>5. Frugality</h2>
<ul>
<li>Don't spend any money unless it does good to yourself or others. (eg. Waste nothing.)</li>
</ul>
<h2>6. Industry</h2>
<ul>
<li>Don't find yourself looking back and going “Oh! Where did the hours go?”</li>
<li>Always be doing something useful.</li>
<li>Get rid of every unnecessary action, either through outsourcing or outright removal.</li>
</ul>
<h2>7. Sincerity</h2>
<ul>
<li>Don't be deceitful unless there is a non-hurtful gain.</li>
<li>Don't have judgments placed prematurely.</li>
<li>Speak without premature judgments and biases.</li>
</ul>
<h2>8. Justice</h2>
<ul>
<li>Don't hurt people by injuring them or not giving them the benefits that you're supposed to provide.</li>
</ul>
<h2>9. Moderation</h2>
<ul>
<li>Avoid extremes.</li>
<li>Don't resent wrongs as much as you think they deserve.</li>
</ul>
<h2>10. Cleanliness</h2>
<ul>
<li>Clean your body regularly and well.</li>
<li>Clean your clothes regularly and well.</li>
<li>Clean your home regularly and well.</li>
</ul>
<h2>11. Tranquility</h2>
<ul>
<li>Don't take arguments personally.</li>
<li>Don't take common or unavoidable accidents personally.</li>
</ul>
<h2>12. Chastity</h2>
<ul>
<li>Don't have sex unless it's for health or children.</li>
<li>Never have sex to the point of satisfaction.</li>
<li>Never have sex out of weakness.</li>
<li>Never have sex if it would injure your's or another's reputation.</li>
</ul>
<h2>13. Humility</h2>
<ul>
<li>Imitate the humility that Socrates and Jesus constantly showed.</li>
</ul>
<h1>How do I put these virtues into action?</h1>
<p>Ben Franklin focused on one each week and trying to make a habit out of each. I say no to that. If you're focusing only on one of the virtues, you can easily break any of the other twelve. Treat this list of virtues as a list of <a title="What should you ask yourself as you’re developing your value system?" href="http://www.rmorabia.com/values/">values</a>, instead. With a list of values, you ask yourself if the decisions you are making (and everything is a decision) aligns with your values. If so, keep going. If not, adjust accordingly.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>I hope you found this interesting. I don't advocate following all of these by any means. I mean, “Avoid extremes,” and “Always be doing something useful?” Those don't seem to be very healthy in the long run.</p>
<p>Benjamin Franklin is still an incredibly inspiring individual, and it'd be absurd to disregard his impact on the world, or at least, the USA. Remember, Benjamin Franklin was the first one to suggest absolute independence from Britain. He came from a middle-class space in a time that was much less equal than it is today. (Most of the founding fathers were aristocratic, regardless of the equality that the USA represents.) Look at how far he came, and it all started with these thirteen virtues.</p>
