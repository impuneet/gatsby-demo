<p>My life philosophy is "Don't be pseudo."</p>
<p>It can be applied everywhere--school, work, relationships, productivity, and health.</p>
<p>It may not be the key to success (this philosophy tends to rub the masses the wrong way), but it's the only way I can live with myself.</p>
<p>I'm not saying I'm any good at my philosophy. People constantly applaud me for being real, brash, and outspoken, but honestly, I'm still constantly pseudo.</p>
<p>I tell myself that I'll do the work today, or that I'm reading a lot, or that I'll start an exercise habit, or that I've been grooming myself daily, but the truth is, I'm not. I'm still a failure.</p>
<blockquote><p>The first principle is that you must not fool yourself, and you are the easiest person to fool. <cite>Richard Feynman</cite></p></blockquote>
<p>Feynman always gets me. I need a huge poster of this in my room, now.</p>
<h1>What is pseudo?</h1>
<p>At this point, some of you may be nodding along in complete understanding while others may be confusing pseudo with a couple of synonyms and completely misunderstanding what I'm trying to say.</p>
<p>So let's define it.</p>
<p>Pseudo is sometimes used interchangeably with "fake," "false," and "lying." All of these are their own words and although they are similar to pseudo, they are not the same thing.</p>
<p><strong>Pseudo is the illusion of reality.</strong></p>
<p>Pseudo-science is masking the real science behind whatever you're talking about. Cable TV's documentaries often fall prey to this, along with hundreds of non-fiction bestsellers.</p>
<p>Pseudo-business is making something, calling yourself an entrepreneur, getting capital, but never making a dime off of your product. (Think social startups: Snapchat, Instagram, Tumblr, etc.)</p>
<p>Pseudo-relationships are when you say you're friends, but really, you're only doing it for the social capital. High-schoolers do this to not look so alone, I don't know about the rest of the world yet. They cluster into groups of 10-30, but within those groups, there are multiple mini-groups--the real friends. These range from 2-5 people.</p>
<p>Pseudo-health is telling people "I go to the gym 4x a week," as if that proves any health. Anyone can get a gym membership and show up. Almost anyone can go to the gym and constantly do the same routine that doesn't help them improve. Only a few use a gym and its resources correctly, constantly pushing themselves further and faster.</p>
<p>(Also, if you drive to the gym only to do cardio--with the exception of swimming--you are pseudo. Cycling, running, and even stair-stepping were all meant to be done in natural environments. Instead of running at the gym, why don't you just run to the gym and back?</p>
<p>I live in Los Angeles, California, in case your excuse is harsh weather. I'm talking about the people I see.)</p>
<p>Pseudo-productivity, or as most people call it these days, busywork, is doing those regurgitating Literary Response and Analysis worksheets for English or constantly checking email/stats. (Unless your direct job title correlates to customer/employee service, you have no excuse.)</p>
<p>I have so many more examples I would love to complain about, but you're starting to see the pattern, right? These people are applauded and praised for their efforts and results, but the truth is--they're doing nothing. Again, the <em>illusion of reality</em>.</p>
<p>It's not lying. These are people who firmly believe that they're doing something real. If someone tells them that they're not, they instantly get defensive and they simply can't handle someone telling them the truth.</p>
<p>(If anyone wants to tell me I'm pseudo about anything, <a href="mailto:hi@rmorabia.com">feel free to</a>. I'm open to criticism, it's better than praise.)</p>
<h1>Why does pseudo matter?</h1>
<p><strong>Progress is being hindered.</strong> Everyone has their own set of ambitions. Whatever people choose to do, no matter how silly it may seem to us, they're always pursuing excellence.</p>
<p>People want to be excellent at their religion, people want to be excellent on Instagram, people want to be excellent writers, and I want to be excellent at math. It's all preference.</p>
<p>But the overarching point is that although people want to be excellent, being pseudo gets in the way.</p>
<p>When you fail, you can so easily convince yourself that the deadline was impossible, that someone else cheated you, or that you would've done well--but you didn't really care.</p>
<p>This is one reason why I stress writing everything down. Your brain so easily adapts to failure, it's hard to be accountable for anything.</p>
<p>For example, I had an unwritten rule in my head that I would publish a post here every Friday night. I missed that every week, so I extended it to one post every weekend. At this point, my schedule is totally messed up.</p>
<p>My excuse? I told myself that what I was writing was very self-serving and no one would want to read it. That isn't a valid reason to not publish the post.</p>
<p>I missed a deadline, and I told myself it was okay.</p>
<p>I later stepped back and started writing this post. That is my life philosophy in action.</p>
<h1>How To Stop Being Pseudo</h1>
<blockquote><p>There is no organization there, just strength of will and purpose. <strong>If you know what you want to do, and who you are, it’s easy not to be distracted by your own bullshit.</strong> If you have illusions about who you are–that is an inflated sense of it–and are, deep down, averse to hard work, it’s impossible to not be distracted by it. Your fear of failure and your creeping awareness that you are a fraud makes it a certainty–a necessity even–that you detour just enough to prevent ever facing a legitimate opportunity to fail. If you fail, the entire edifice collapses.<cite><a href="&quot;http://www.ryanholiday.net/an-interview-with-me/">RYAN HOLIDAY</a></cite></p></blockquote>
<p>(emphasis mine)</p>
<h2>Step 1: Define your values.</h2>
<p>What's pseudo to me might be real to you. What's real to me might be pseudo to you. Look at the people around you, look at people in the world, and figure out what you hate about these people and what you admire about these people.</p>
<p>I value people who work hard towards real results. I value authenticity and being open about who you are: your struggles and your successes. I value being honest with your opinions, but doing the work required to have that opinion.</p>
<p>Prime examples of my values lie in: Nassim Taleb, Aaron Swartz, and Ryan Holiday.</p>
<p>These are some very controversial figures, but maybe that's what I value.</p>
<p>It's also very important to figure out what you don't value at all. Otherwise, you can be lenient.</p>
<p>I hate consultants, people whose biggest accomplishment happened 20 years ago, people who only read non-fiction, and pseudo-intellectuals (there are a bunch of factors that go into this, but I think the #1 giveaway is if you read multiple lightweight mystery/YA bestsellers a week and consider yourself to be smarter than everyone else).</p>
<p>Get as specific as you can. Some questions I would ask myself to figure this out:</p>
<ul>
<li>What 3-5 people do I admire most in the world?</li>
<li>What about them is admirable?</li>
<li>What 3-5 people do I disrespect most in the world?</li>
<li>Why do I disrespect them?</li>
<li>What do I want to be? (not a career question)</li>
<li>What would I rather die than be?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Step 2: Apply your values to your priorities.</h2>
<p>This one's much simpler than the last one. You probably already know your priorities. For most people, it's work, health, and relationships.</p>
<p>If you don't know, think of what you do every day, without fail. Maybe it's music, maybe it's gaming, your priorities don't have to fit into the societal mold. Also, take a look at your long-term goals. That can really help you sort out your priorities.</p>
<p>After figuring out your priorities (take some time, don't be psuedo about this, too), ask yourself where your values align with these priorities--what you should and shouldn't be doing.</p>
<p>Get really specific about this. Make sure there's nothing abstract that you can allow yourself to bend to your advantage when you fail.</p>
<p>You're basically assigning rules for how you're going to moving forward with your priorities. These are borders, and although they're made of rubber, they can help you progress forward with more purpose and satisfaction.</p>
<h2>Step 3: Make an accessible representation.</h2>
<p>This is going to be your go-to for decision making and reviewing situations.</p>
<p>You can have a document on your computer, a blown up poster, or a piece of scrap paper taped to your computer, anything, as long as it makes sense to you and is very specific.</p>
<p>You're trying to catch yourself failing here, and if you're perfect every day, your values are way too loose. You're probably justifying your actions and decisions to put you in the better light.</p>
<p>You need to constantly look at this and have it either sting or taste like a sweet. It doesn't necessarily have to be extreme, but it must be strict.</p>
<h2>Step 4: Align as needed.</h2>
<p>Refer to this as often as possible, but at the same time, align your values as needed. <a href="http://www.rmorabia.com/read/">If you read a book and discover that your values are shifted</a>, adjust accordingly.</p>
<p>Never stick to one ideology for too long, especially if you have conclusive evidence that this different way is better.</p>
<p>At the same time, don't adjust too often. Make sure that you have extremely valid support for this change (more than one source).</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Seriously, try this out for a month. Having your values dictate your life actually attracts opportunities and people who align with your values to your life. Crazy, right?</p>
<p>No more sneering under your breath about the environment you're stuck with, because the toxic environment you find yourself in will be turned off by your real self and run away.</p>
<p>It's about being more honorable in a world that lacks it, and Nassim Taleb, <em>New York Times</em> Bestselling Author and multi-millionaire, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1aoi0s/iam_nassim_taleb_author_of_antifragile_ama/c8zaarp">says</a> that "a sense of honor...puts you above everything else."</p>
