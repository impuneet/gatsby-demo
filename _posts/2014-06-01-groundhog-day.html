<p>This had a really interesting concept. What would you do if you had forever without any consequences?</p>

<p>The answer to that seemed very natural. First, have fun sinning. But after a while, sinning does get very boring.</p>

<p>Then, try to make do everything you can before your clock resets again. This was kind of creepy in this movie, though. Movies with mild time travel like this are always a little creepy.</p>

<p>Next, the suicide attempts. There were so many.</p>

<p>Finally, art. Learn art, create art, and fall in love with all kinds of art. That was amazing to me, and something that so many movies miss.</p>

<p>But the movie overall? I got a little bored. Again, interesting concept, but it wasn't engaging enough. It was a bit repetitive, as well.</p>
