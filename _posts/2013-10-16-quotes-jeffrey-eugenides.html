<blockquote>We Greeks are a moody people. Suicide makes sense to us. Putting up Christmas lights after your own daughter does itâ€“that makes no sense. What my yia yia could never understand about America was why everyone pretended to be happy all the time. <cite>Jeffrey Eugenides: The Virgin Suicides</cite></blockquote>

<blockquote>The essence of the suicides consisted not of sadness or mystery but simple selfishness. The girls took into their own hands decisions better left to God. They became too powerful to live among us, too self-concerned, too visionary, too blind. What lingered after them was not life, which always overcomes natural death, but the most trivial list of mundane facts: a clock ticking on a wall, a room dim at noon, and the outrageousness of a human being thinking only of herself. <cite>Jeffery Eugenides: The Virgin Suicides</cite></blockquote>
