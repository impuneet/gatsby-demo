I was diagonosed with heavy [astigmatism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astigmatism) a few weeks ago and had to get glasses. Here's my experience going from practically never using glasses to having to wear glasses for extended periods of time every day.

## Day 1: July 7th, 2014

- disorienting
- red/blue colors show up at the edges of my peripheral vision
- flat books shaped like a trapezoid
- table looks slanted - like [Relativity by M.C. Escher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_%28M._C._Escher%29)
	- all the stuff on my desk should be sliding off of the "lowest point" of the table
	- but it all abides by normal gravity and physics, as if it wasn't insanely slanted
- real-life tripping
- reading is still difficult, it's just a new problem

## Day 2: July 8th, 2014

- anxiety related to putting them on, because I don't feel safe.
- table still looks like Relativity and anything flat and straight still looks like a trapezoid
- eyesight only increased when I focus on something, otherwise, peripheral vision is probably bad enough to cause my death
- taking off glasses makes eyesight the blurriest experience I've ever had
- I look like such a nerd.

## Day 3: July 9th, 2014

- Is Relativity how the real world is?
- Why can't glasses cover your entire vision instead of the small area right in front of you?

## Day 4: July 10th, 2014

- The headaches, the colors, Relativity, it's all the real world. There is no recovery from here on out, the world has morphed to fit the way my glasses make the world look.
- I can finally read really well, but the headaches aren't allowing me to.
- Is it foggy or are my glasses dirty, even though I just cleaned them?

## Day 5: July 11th, 2014

- The glasses and I have become one.
- When the glasses aren't on my face, I feel the ghost of the frame sitting on my nose.
