<p>No, not now.</p>
<p>Chances are, you've found yourself at the end of a series of bad choices. If you're a student cramming for finals, a freelancer who didn't do the project you have to give your client next week, or an employee who hasn't been meeting their daily quotas for a while now, you're thinking "Alright, it's time to change my life. I'm going to make sure this never happens to me again."</p>
<p>Right now, while you're in this rut, do whatever's working for you. Sprint over the finish line because you walked the rest of it. Do whatever works, no matter how cheap and wrong it feels.</p>
<p>Then, when everything's calmed down--a new semester, a new client, a new year, change your life.</p>
<p>Changing your life is slow and it requires you to not have <em>this</em> much on your plate. You can only change one thing at a time, and if you're trying to change while all of your energy is going towards cleaning up your mess, you won't change--and worse, you'll forget about changing your life until things get this drastic again.</p>
<p>So, change your life when the cycle restarts. Put a post-it where you can see it to remind yourself to change when things get easy again.</p>
<p>What should you change, if you can only choose one thing? Start with exercise. Running or weight-lifting can give the fastest, most motivating results. Regular exercise will increase your energy, focus, happiness, willpower, pretty much everything important.</p>
<p>Also, if your end result during this hectic time is less than desirable, don't stress too much. Think about it--will this affect you in 10 years? Opportunities come and go. This won't ruin your life, I promise.</p>
