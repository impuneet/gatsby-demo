We all want to be better people, yes?

We want to go to read more books, go to the gym more often, and learn to play an instrument.

The easiest way to become a better person is to install a habit. So, if you want to read more books, make it a habit to read for an hour every day. If you want to go to the gym more often, make it a habit to go to the gym every single day. If you want to learn to play an instrument, make it a habit to practice daily.

How do we go about developing a habit?

Common advice is as follows--start small, with something like flossing. Then, commit to it, every single day! Finally, after 30 days (or 21, or 42, there's huge debate over the number of days you need to develop a habit), your habit will be formed! What's next?

I've tried this before, time and time again. When I'm in a rut and I start to get that urge to [change my life](http://rmorabia.com/change), I go back to habit creation and the next year, I find myself in the exact same rut.

But, recently, I've come across a foolproof strategy for habit creation. It's not sexy, it's not smooth, but it works.

## 5 Steps to Creating Lifelong Habits

It's actually very simple to create habits. Once you start to realize that sheer willpower will get you no results, you can move onto what actually works, with the help of the psychology.

This isn't just a system to develop one habit, it's a system to continually develop new habits while maintaining your old habits, so you don't have to worry about losing some.

### 1. Define the habit.

Do you know the reason why most New Year's resolutions fail?

It's because they're not defined well enough. "I want to go to the gym more." Well, what exactly does that mean? If you never went to the gym before, and now you went once every two months, you've technically gone more, right?

When you have unclear habits like this, it's so easy to rationalize and justify and tell yourself that you've reached your goal when you really, truly haven't.

So, frame your desired habit a yes or no question that you can't squeeze your way around.

For example, one of the habits I'm trying to acquire right now is defined like so, "Did I sleep by midnight?"

It's simple and there's no way to cheat myself out of it. Either I was in bed at 12:00 AM or not.

### 2. Track the habit.

You need some kind of visual representation of when you lost or when you won.

[I use a table in a spreadsheet on my computer.](http://rmorabia.com/tracking) I like this because it's shockingly easy after the initial set-up, and I can use the data in a variety of ways. For example, I've created a chart which lists my progress alongside the table so that I can more easily document my progress over time.

If you know you're not going to use your computer every day, get some graph paper and create a table, or get a monthly fridge calendar that you can write on, and take pictures at the end of the month. There are also smartphone apps that do this.

Do it however you want, just make sure it's:

- easy to fill out every single day.
- archivable.
- can only let you answer yes/no, no justification or notes allowed.

Don't overthink this. Choose one method and stick to it.

### 3. Use the psychology of colors.

This is possibly the most revolutionary part of this method.

Green means good/go/positive.

Red means bad/stop/negative.

It's ingrained in your brain. Just look at your favorite video games, or the signs on the street. You associate colors with meaning, and we can capitalize on that.

When you are able to answer yes for the day, you're able to get a green light telling you that you did a good job. But, when you do a bad job and didn't complete your habit, you get a dreaded red light. Your streak is ruined, it's ugly, and you very quickly start to do almost anything to avoid getting the red light.

If you're using a spreadsheet like I am, all you have to do is change the background color of your cell to red or green. If you're using a whiteboard or paper, be sure to buy red/green pens.

Do not underestimate the power of this part. If you skip this, don't [email me](mailto:hi@rmorabia.com) saying this didn't work for you.

### 4. Aim for a 70% success rate.

You probably have 30 habits that you want right now, right? And with the conventional way of one habit a month, it'll take 3 years to achieve what you want.

Here's a way to make massive progress in a much shorter amount of time:

1. Start with the 3 most important and impactful habits.
2. If you get higher than 70% completion that week, add a new habit.
3. If you get lower than 70% completion that week, get rid of your least important habit, up until you're left with just one or two.
4. If you have just one left, you're not allowed to just drop that and give up. Try your hardest to reach a 70% success rate, there is no quitting here.

If you succeed week after week, you can reach having 30 habits within half a year. That's much faster than the 3 years it would take you assuming the conventional method worked.

Note, it won't be all good. You'll progress a week, fall back a week, maybe even two weeks, and you'll just be constantly clawing your way forward while facing massive resistance. Again, this isn't sexy, but it works.

### 5. Be accountable.

[I publish the results of my habit tracking on my website.](http://rmorabia.com/tracking)

It isn't pretty, and it probably puts me in a very negative light considering how terrible I am at sticking to my habits. But I know that at least one person is going to look at how many red lights I have, and it makes me want to be better.

If you don't have a website or somewhere to share your habit tracking, [email me](mailto:hi@rmorabia.com). I'll be the one person who sees your habit results each week, or I'll set you up with someone.

## Limitations to Habit Tracking

This method works pretty well. Even though I am getting a huge amount of red lights, the margins that I'm missing by are much more beneficial before, where I just said to myself, "Well, I want to sleep earlier..."

Instead of, "Okay, I'll sleep soon," only to look out of the window hours later and notice that the sun is rising, I'm scrambling into bed at 12:10AM because I just had to finish whatever I was doing.

But, this method isn't perfect. It only works with daily habits, so if you want to do something once a week, it'll be much harder to instill. There's also no way for you to take a break or justify your actions. Either you do it or you don't.

In a way, this method's inability to accommodate to different needs makes it even more effective for the type of person and habit it's made for. You do your habit every day or you don't. There's no wiggle room here.

## Conclusion

This method has worked extraordinarily well for me within my few weeks of following it, and if you're the type of person who tried developing habits many times before, only to fail again and again, this could fix it for you.

It'll be very, very hard when you start, but the gains are tremendous, and they come almost immediately. I highly recommend at least trying it out, because we all have at least some habits we wish we could follow.
