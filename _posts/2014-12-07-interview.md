title: Who should I interview?
date: December 7th, 2014
summary: I want the answer to career foundations and regrets, and most people gloss over it like it's obvious. I don't care about the now--I can find out the now from any other interview. I care about the beginnings and the why.

I love reading and listening to interviews. My favorite podcast is [WTF with Marc Maron](http://wtfpod.com) and I dive through [The Paris Review archives](http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews) religiously.

Oftentimes, though, nobody asks the questions I'm wondering I want the answer to. I want the answer to career foundations and regrets, and most people gloss over it like it's obvious. I don't care about the now--I can find out the now from any other interview. I care about the beginnings and the why.

So, I'm starting up an interview series. There's no official title for it and it'll show up on the blog just like any other post, there's no need to subscribe to anything new.

I need a favor, though. If I just wanted to know about the people I'm interested in, I'd send them an email directly. I'm doing this for the benefit of both you and I, so please tell me how I can benefit you.

If you could choose one person (realistically--I'm not the most connected person in the world) who you could also about their foundations, who would they be, and why?

Please fill out the form below to let me know.
