title: Who should I interview?
date: December 7th, 2014
summary: I want the answer to career foundations and regrets, and most people gloss over it like it's obvious. I don't care about the now--I can find out the now from any other interview. I care about the beginnings and the why.

I love reading and listening to interviews. My favorite podcast is [WTF with Marc Maron](http://wtfpod.com) and I dive through [The Paris Review archives](http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews) religiously.

Oftentimes, though, nobody asks the questions I'm wondering about. I want the answer to the career foundations and regrets that most people gloss over. I don't care about the now--I can find out the now from any other interview. I care about the beginnings and the why behind the success

So, I'm starting up an interview series. I'm going to be asking questions that I find interesting to people I admire. I'll be publishing the results on the blog so that you can also learn from these people.

I need a favor, though. If I just wanted to know about the people I'm interested in, I'd send them an email directly. I'm doing this for the benefit of both you and I, so please tell me how I can benefit you.

If you could choose one person who you could ask about their foundations, who would they be, and why?

Please fill out the form below to let me know.
