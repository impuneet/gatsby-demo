<p>I know what you're thinking. This punk teenager is going to teach me how to listen to music? What does she know? Hear me out.</p>
<p>I've gone from only listening to music that was pushed upon me to making my whole life revolve around the most popular radio station in Los Angeles to forcing bands on myself to fit in with a certain demographic to having a crazy-wide array of music which I feel a deep emotional connection to.</p>
<p>I'm very deliberate with all of my music and twice a year (mostly by accident), I purge it all and start back from zero, with a very slow and delibrate rebuild of my collection.</p>
<p>I have a very specific framework for what makes its way onto my mp3 player and into my ears. I'm sharing it with you today. Note that this framework relies on your method of listening being primarily through an mp3 player, and not CDs or streaming on the internet.</p>
<h2>1. Focus on albums, not tracks.</h2>
<p>A vast majority of people only get artists' singles. It's just the way the music world has turned out.</p>
<p>I'm here to say it's wrong. In the top .1% of musicians, the best work seems to be in the singles, but the rest of the music world seems puts work into entire albums.</p>
<p>I rarely encounter albums where my favorite tracks are the singles.</p>
<p>Try it out. The next time you encounter a single you enjoy, try getting the entire album. See which tracks are your favorites by the end of the week.</p>
<h2>2. Stop working out of iTunes.</h2>
<p>Most of my early purges were due to iTunes simply messing up. iTunes is clunky and forces you to use your computer far too often.</p>
<p>Support for audiobooks and podcasts that you didn't get inside the closed system is rare, so it'll muddle with your music, and suddenly you'll start hearing Chapter 37 of a book while your music is on Shuffle mode. Remember, <a href="http://rmorabia.com/privacy">open is always better than closed</a>.</p>
<p>Also, iTunes has a terrible tendency to remind you of your purchased music. This brings us to our next point...</p>
<h2>3. Don't be afraid to delete.</h2>
<p>If this song annoys you, or if an entire artist's discography has suddenly lost its appeal, never be afraid to delete. But, you spent money on it! But, you have a compulsive need to look like you have a large collection to show off to your friends! But, you liked it at one point! Delete it.</p>
<p>If the song, album, or artist is good, it will find its way back to you.</p>
<p>(Another reason why you shouldn't use iTunes, deleting a song is the biggest hassle in the world. On my mp3 player, I can delete straight from the device, without a computer and without any hassle. If you can't do that with your mp3 player, consider switching.)</p>
<h2>4. Put music you're experimenting with on your mp3 player.</h2>
<p>I used to have a playlist in Spotify titled "Explore this further." Basically, I had heard a single from an artist once and I generally liked it, but I needed to feel an emotional connection to them. There's no way I'm ever going to have the time or motivation to "feel an emotional connection with them." The only way to do it was to force the albums upon myself.</p>
<p>As an example, I was reading an interview with <a href="http://the-talks.com/interviews/phoenix/">Phoenix on The Talks</a>, so I decided to listen to a song. It was good, and then I downloaded their entire discography. Here, a few weeks later, I'm finding out I really only like their first album and I'm slowly going through deleting the rest.</p>
<h2>5. Find an emotional connection to your music.</h2>
<p>I have music that my friends told me reminds them of me. That's an emotional connection. I have the soundtracks to all of my favorite movies, either those that make me sob or laugh. That's an emotional connection. I think <a href="http://rmorabia.com/2k13">Frank Turner</a> knows the meaning of life. That's an emotional connection.</p>
<p>Find your own emotional connection. Sure, it's enough to like the way a song sounds, but with just that, you can't ever feel fulfilled with your music. You can't ever turn to your music in case of hard times. You can't ever get lost in your music.</p>
<p>I currently have 697 tracks on my mp3 player, and each one either means the world to me, or I'm experimenting with them. What can you say about your collection?</p>
<p>Remember, it's not about the genre, lyrics,or popularity. It's about the music.</p>
<h1>Recommended Tech for Listening to Music</h1>
<h3>MP3 Player: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002MAPT7U/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002MAPT7U&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=radhimorab0c-20">Sandisk Sansa Clip+</a></h3>
<p>For less than $100, you can get anywhere from 4-72GB for your music. I have 36GB. Take that, iPod.</p>
<p>There's also support for FLAC and other lossless files. You add music through the computer, but instead of trashy software like iTunes, you just use a file manager. It's exactly like a USB drive, except it plays music!</p>
<p>Have I mentioned that I can delete songs straight from the player? This is true bliss.</p>
<h3>Headphones: Anything but iPod earbuds and Beats By Dre</h3>
<p>Three years ago, I bought a pair of Sony headphones for $25. I still use them today.</p>
<p>Seriously, headphones don't have to cost that much. Check out <a href="http://collegeinfogeek.com/the-best-headphones-for-students-broke-ass-edition/">Thomas Frank's post on the best headphones under $50</a> if you want great quality for a very affordable price.</p>
<h3>Audio File: MP3 320kbps+ or FLAC</h3>
<p>I'm a picky audiophile. A lot of my music's appeal is from there being a multitude of layers, some of them subtle. I need high quality, or I won't hear the subtlety.</p>
<p>Something like MP3 128kbps would only give you the melody and harmony. You can't get trapped in something so flat.</p>
<p>Yes, you can hold less songs if you only opt for high-quality music, but it's worth it. Remember, you should be feeling an emotional connection to all of your music anyway. I'd be shocked to learn you feel emotionally connected to 72GB worth.</p>
<h3>Streaming (for discovery): Spotify or artist's site</h3>
<p>If you're in a country that supports Spotify, why aren't you using it yet? It's great for seeing whether an artist has a sound you like.</p>
<p>If you can't use Spotify, don't go back to YouTube. Come on, everyone knows that YouTube decreases audio quality upon upload to save space. Go to an artist's website. They might use Soundcloud or their own media player to showcase their music.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>I hope that you love music as much as I do. I don't keep my music on all the time, so whenever I get to listen to music, I cherish it.</p>
