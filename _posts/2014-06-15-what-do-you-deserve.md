I've been trying to improve multiple parts of my life quite rapidly. I want to look good, learn web development, and grow this site--all at once.

I haven't been making as much progress as I'd like to. I get stuck mentally and I keep doing things I don't want to be doing.

Just tonight, I spent hours on this flash game that I didn't even like very much.

Why?

I don't want to do the hard stuff.

Knowing this, do I deserve the results I want? Do I deserve to look good, feel good, create awesome websites, and have an amazing personal database that people appreciate?

No.

Was I giving my absolute best to get these results I want?

No.

What did I do instead?

I made excuses.

I've been injured the past few days, so I'm in pain, and it's hot, and I'm not comfortable, and I'm tired, and sitting in my bed is so comfortable.

These are all excuses, at least for my goals. Being injured may be a valid reason to not do a specific kind of work, but my goals don't involve much physical activity anyway. 

Do I deserve the results I want if I made excuses?

Not at all.

When would I deserve the results I want?

I'll deserve the results I want when I put in my all.

I can't just put in my all one day and only come back to it 20 days later. I'll deserve the results I want when I put in my all every single day.

When I put in my all every single day, the results will be even better than the results I wanted in the first place. I'll be so enwrapped in the process and actually enjoying my days, the results I originally wanted will be surpassed many times over.

Remember, set small goals every day, and then build on the momentum of completion. For example, if you want to read a book, tell yourself you have to read one page. Chances are, once that starts, you'll keep reading. If not, no problem, find something else to stick for the day.

As long as all these goals relate to your results, and you do a little bit each day, you'll reach and surpass in no time.

Then, when you look back and see your results, instead of saying you deserve more than you currently have, you'll think "I don't deserve this much!" Most of the world is barely any competition. Surpass a certain point, and everyone can have a piece of the pie. There's more than enough to go around if you're willing to put in the work.

*This was obviously a note to self. I'm posting this because I'm hoping it will hit some chords.*
