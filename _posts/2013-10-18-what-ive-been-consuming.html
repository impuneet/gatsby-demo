This is a monthly series that documents what I've consumed and, from music to movies and video games to books. It doesn't include everything I've consumed this month, but things that have made an impact or left an impression on me. This is for my own personal tracking, so if this doesn't interest you, feel free to move right along.
<h1>Books</h1>
After my Kindle broke, I didn't read for months. <a href="http://ryanholiday.net">Ryan Holiday's writings</a> changed that dramatically. Once I had to buy books for school, I snatched up the opportunity to pick up some books that had been on my to-read list, which recently jumped from 10 or 20 books to 556 items as of today. (<a href="http://amzn.com/w/V9ZYYLHO3DXP">Buy me books?</a>)

So here's what I've read over the course of August and September, a dramatic increase over the amount I'd read when I had to rely on a library:
<ul>
	<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743250621/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0743250621&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=radhimorab0c-20"><em>The Know-It-All</em> by AJ Jacobs</a>.</strong> I hate this book. I despise it with all of my being. There's a lot of praise for it around the internet, <a href="http://chrisguillebeau.com/3x5/the-one-year-alternative-graduate-school-program/">even by Chris Guillebeau.</a> It's a really bad book, though. It's as if he got paid by the page to droll on about his own life and insecurities. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NWSHW2JYTEKY/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm">Here's my review on Amazon.</a> However, if you want the best review out there, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/03/books/review/03QUEENAN.html?_r=0">check out Joe Queenan's.</a></li>
	<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0486278077/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0486278077&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=radhimorab0c-20"><em>The Picture of Dorian Gray</em> by Oscar Wilde</a>. </strong>This is one I had to read for school. It even had a nice "<em>*district approved</em>" on the sheet. I expected it to be a Dickens-style novel, but I didn't realize, the time period's totally different. This is so easy to read and so deep at the same time. Psychology, ethics, and philosophy are all covered in this short book. I'd recommend it to everyone. Wilde is a genius.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312428812/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0312428812&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=radhimorab0c-20"><em>The Virgin Suicides</em> by Jeffrey Eugenides</a>. </strong>This is a bit different from my usual obsession with books that are at least 50 years old--this was written in 1993. However, Eugenides is a Pulitzer winner (for his second book), and that comes across really well in his writing. The book is about the American suburbs in the 50's or 60's, and I could feel the sense of that era better than any book from the era. If you're looking for literature about American society and mental health, this is a go-to. It's pure genius and it's changed my view on a couple of things.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0486290735/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0486290735&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=radhimorab0c-20"><em>The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin</em> by Benjamin Franklin</a>. </strong>The above three, I've finished, but here we go into books I haven't finished yet. I like this book, but I'm still stuck in the first thirds of the book, which is filled with family anecdotes and not written for the public. It's a good book, and for the era it's written in, it comes across as a very readable account. It definitely gives a human view to the American genius. I recommend it. It's in the Harvard Classics (I believe).</li>
	<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0679723161/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0679723161&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=radhimorab0c-20"><em>Lolita </em>by Vladimir Nabokov</a>.</strong> <em></em>Oh god, this book. I've tried to tackle it since January of 2013. I'm somewhere deep in the middle, as of October of 2013. I finally have the physical copy, though, so hopefully that'll make this a bit faster. However, it's just such a haunting novel, my emotions can't take more than one chapter at a time. It's weeks before I feel the inclination to pick it back up. I haven't since July. I'll probably finish this when I carve out a weekend and force myself through it. But it's really good. I haven't finished it yet, but I believe it's going to replace <em>Gone With the Wind</em> as my favorite.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061119067/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0061119067&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=radhimorab0c-20"><em>A Series of Unfortunate Events</em> by Lemony Snicket</a>. </strong>I read part of this as a kid, but again--libraries. I have a big issue with libraries. I often spoke badly about the series, and I realize--I don't remember the series at all. I have no right to speak ill about it. So, I got audiobooks of the series. I'm strongly opposed to audiobooks, but I'm not reading to analyze the text or find foreshadowing. It's been very productive so far. I'm on Book 4 out of 13. I don't like the books, however. They're condescending, repetitive, and the author tries to be too spooky. I'll finish the series, though, if only to give me the credibility to criticize.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0545596270/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0545596270&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=radhimorab0c-20"><em>Harry Potter</em> by J.K. Rowling</a>. </strong>I'm also reading the entirety of the <em>Harry Potter Series</em> through audiobook. Honestly, it's just a way for me to cheap out. Buying series like this can cost $100+, and torrenting an audiobook file of Jim Dale reading it all for me is my way of cheaping out. It just isn't valuable enough for me to spend that money. I spoke badly about this series, too, so I decided to give it another go. I was so wrong. It turns out, my views were tainted by the movies. These books are good works of fiction. They're interesting with dynamic characters and with deep relationships. There's nothing to analyze here, but they are a good source of entertainment, and I still like them for the reasons I liked them as a kid--J.K. Rowling is not a condescending writer. I'm on The Chamber of Secrets, my favorite movie of the seven.</li>
</ul>
I bought books waiting to be read, including <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812968255/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0812968255&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=radhimorab0c-20"><em>Meditations</em> by Marcus Aurelius</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316769487/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316769487&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=radhimorab0c-20"><em>The Catcher in the Rye</em> by J.D. Salinger</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/048647061X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=048647061X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=radhimorab0c-20"><em>The Trial</em> by Franz Kafka</a>. I'm very excited to get to them, but I hope to finish Ben Franklin's Autobiography first. We're also reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743273567/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0743273567&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=radhimorab0c-20"><em>The Great Gatsby </em>by F. Scott Fitzgerald</a> in class, and I'll comment on that next month.

<em>Quick Note About Book Series</em>: I absolutely despise book series. I understand it's a way to get kids to read more, but it's a cheap way to extract more money out of an audience that can't afford it (I got $4-5 a week in allowance). The books are repetitive and waste precious space reminding the audience of certain constants, and if you don't have the creativity to put your series into one book--no matter the size, please stop publishing. I have stopped many series halfway because I simply outgrew them. And now I'll never know the endings...
<h1>Articles</h1>
There was a point in my life when I read hundreds of articles a day, many long-form. I've made a very deliberate choice to not read so many articles anymore. The problem is that articles very rarely change your life or are worth the hours of input. Though, sometimes they do, and that's pretty awesome.

Nowadays, I really only read what comes up in my RSS feed. My RSS feed is awesome, though.
<ul>
	<li><strong><a href="http://leesandlin.com/articles/LosingTheWar.htm">"Losing the War" by Lee Sandlin.</a> </strong>Recommendation by Ryan Holiday. This article is around the length of a novel, but it's probably the best thing you'll ever read on American War. Sandlin has a very readable voice and the article is well-researched and thought out. I'd highly recommend it, but print it out. Reading something so valuable on a screen makes it lose importance.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="http://charliehoehn.com/2013/05/19/how-i-cured-my-anxiety/">"How I Cured My Anxiety" by Charlie Hoehn.</a> </strong>I'd only heard of Charlie in passing. One night, I sat down and read through a ton of his archive. I printed this post out and it changed my view on how to approach work and life. He has a memoir coming out soon, basically an expansion of this post, and I'm eagerly looking forward to it.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="http://www.ryanholiday.net/25-rules-for-living-from-a-semi-successful-26-year-old/">"25 Rules For Living From A (Semi-)Successful 26-Year-Old" by Ryan Holiday.</a> </strong>Each time Ryan Holiday publishes something I relate to, I get giddy inside. This is some valuable contrarian advice I read a few months ago when he posted it on ThoughtCatalog. My favorite is the rule about not reclining your seat on airplanes. I had just come back from an uncomfortable plane ride from India (Los Angeles to Mumbai is one of the furthest plane rides in the world), and was committed to not reclining my seat. I was told it was a senseless decision, but having Ryan put my values more eloquently is awesome.<strong>
</strong></li>
	<li><strong><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/2013/08/why-teach-english.html">"Why Teach English" by Adam Gopnik.</a> </strong>The past summer has been littered with people commenting on the loss of the humanities. There are two sides: the STEM side, and the humanities side. I'm personally on the STEM side (you're paying $50,000 a year for someone to tell you how to interpret $200 of books), but this article presents a viewpoint that isn't the crybaby nature of most for-humanities articles. I recommend it if you're interested in this debate.</li>
</ul>
I've also recently been seeing a lot of people I follow on Delicious. I've personally been using Pocket to read my stuff, but Pocket doesn't integrate with things I don't save for later. I hope I can compile everything I read online with Delicious. If you want to follow me on Delicious, <a href="http://www.delicious.com/rmorabia">here's my account.</a>
<h1>Movies</h1>
This has been a very movie-light month. I continue to chance upon movies I want to watch, and then I notice there are books those movies are based off of. Especially after the Harry Potter incident (see above), I hope to never watch a movie based off of a book before I read the book again. American Psycho, Fight Club, and others wait on this list.
<ul>
	<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008E4FGZS/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B008E4FGZS&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=radhimorab0c-20">Ishaqzaade</a>/<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00F1RTVWA/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00F1RTVWA&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=radhimorab0c-20">Lootera</a>. </strong>I've seen these two movies before, but I rewatched them recently, and they're timeless. They're both Romantic Dramas, so if you don't want to sob your heart out, don't watch. But, if you like Nicholas Sparks and stuff, you don't know romance until you watch these movies. Ishaqzaade's on Netflix, if you want to check that out. Both have DVDs on Amazon, linked above.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Video Games</h1>
I'm no longer a heavy gamer, but if someone tells me that this game changed their life, I will check it out.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Earthbound (SNES). </strong>I originally watched <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC72AA488BAA34677">Stephen Georg's Let's Play of Earthbound</a> while I was in India. Stephen's really cool and he emits such passion and knowledge about this game, I had to check it out. This game is a depiction of America--made by the Japanese. I'm obviously obsessed with what it means to be an American and how foreigners view America (see <em>Lolita</em>), and this was a great addition to those viewpoints. The music is amazing, the characters are amazing, and the humor is unmatchable. I definitely recommend it. If you have a WiiU, it just got on the store. If you don't, you can ROM it, which is a tiny bit illegal, but easier than spending $100 on a used SNES. (If you want to play it but don't understand ROMs, <a href="mailto:rmorabia@hush.com">email me</a> and I'll help you out.)</li>
	<li><strong>Chrono Trigger (SNES).</strong> This has been named the best RPG of all time numerous times, and I can see why. Gameplay is easy, story is magnificent, music is marvelous, and characters are dynamic. I adore this game. It's a bit long, I've been playing it for a very long time, but it's great. Like the above, you can ROM it. Email me and I'll set you up.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Music</h1>
Music is very haphazard for me. Some months, I find more albums than I can handle, while others, not so much. I use Spotify for discovery and if you're very particular about how you listen on there, it can lead you to great finds. I then buy the album in the highest quality I can and transfer it to my mp3 player.

Also, about my music taste: I can find a pattern in my music that most people don't understand, but honestly--I can love everything. And I mean everything: Punk Rock, Funk, Lyrical, Non-Lyrical, Dance, Folk, Rap, everything. As long as I feel I can jam, I love it.

I treat vocals like an instrument, and value the music, the quality of the instrumentation, and the originality and personality of the piece. I will never like a song with relatable lyrics if the vocalist has no personality. I find emotions in music which have nothing to do with lyrics, and I really like the way I view music now.

I also only download albums. If your single is the best thing on your album, chances are, I won't get your album. Anyway, onto the music:
<ul>
	<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005QW1FB0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B005QW1FB0&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=radhimorab0c-20">The Greatest Video Game Music by the London Philharmonic Orchestra</a>. </strong>I heard the version of Tetris Theme A, and the amount of personality and originality put into it gave me shivers. The original is genius itself, and I love playing Tetris to this theme, but oh man, this version is gorgeous. I heard the rest of the album and had to buy it. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005QW1FB0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B005QW1FB0&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=radhimorab0c-20">Each song is only $.33, so why not?</a></li>
	<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00195FU4Q/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00195FU4Q&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=radhimorab0c-20">Three Flights from Alto Nido by Greg Laswell</a>. </strong>I haven't had the time to explore this album in-depth enough, but it's just a very pleasant listen. The instrumentation and the use of vocals is very unique and I, quite frankly, like the sound.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005HI7MUG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B005HI7MUG&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=radhimorab0c-20">Odd Soul by Mutemath</a>. </strong>You can tell how much personality went into this album. It reminds me of Neon Trees' Habits, but better. Original, jam-packed, and gorgeous. I jam to do this all the time.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Frank-Turner/e/B001LHXD5K/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;qid=1382122246&amp;sr=1-1&amp;tag=radhimorab0c-20">Everything by Frank Turner</a>. </strong>Everything isn't one of Frank's albums. I just mean every album by Frank Turner. I adore Frank Turner. He's passionate, skilled, and very original. He has the ability to make music without any instruments, and he sounds good live (a very important factor in musicians). Once I got used to his sound, read interviews, and listened for his lyrics, I really identified with his character and who he is. A combination of all of this has made him my current favorite artist. If you're going to listen, start with Tape Deck Heart, his latest album.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="http://starmen.net/mother2/music/">Earthbound soundtrack.</a> </strong>I was playing Earthbound for a few weeks until I started to get withdrawals. I was reading a book, and suddenly the Drug Store theme got in my head and I knew I had to go download the soundtrack. My favorite tracks are the ones correlated with The Runaway Five (especially Get On the Bus). Also, totally different style of music, but the Chrono Trigger soundtrack is great, too.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Other</h1>
<ul>
	<li><strong><a href="http://lewishowes.com/category/podcast/">The School of Greatness (podcast).</a> </strong>I was looking for interviews of Charlie Hoehn when I came across this podcast by Lewis Howes. The group of people he interviews and his natural aptitude for interviewing makes this a great listen. I've listened to Charlie's and Robert Greene's, both of which have blown me away. I don't normally like podcasts, but if you interview cool people, I'm always into that.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="http://prism-break.org">PRISM Break.</a> </strong>If you have any concern for privacy or the open movement on the web, this is a good compendium of ways to protect yourself. Not all of it requires technical prowess to implement, but one comment about about the open web: I don't consider myself a technical person and I'm not going to go into the tech industry, but <strong>you have no power unless you know some tech. </strong><a href="http://evbogue.com">Ev Bogue probably said this better than me at some point.</a></li>
	<li><strong><a href="http://independentpublisher.me">Independent Publisher by Raam Dev (Wordpress Theme).</a> </strong>This is the theme I'm using here. It's super readable, super responsive, and it requires me to customize very little. Sign up for the mailing list to be notified when it comes out in full gear. I'm just a beta tester.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
I'm starting to make this a regular part of my posting schedule for two reasons. First, I'd like to track my consumption. Second, all everyone talks about is what they're reading! Every other category in this post has contributed to my life as much as books, if not more. Every medium is valuable as long as you give it a chance.

I hope you enjoyed this, and if you have any recommendations or want to talk about anything I consumed, leave a comment or <a href="mailto:rmorabia@hush.com">send an email</a>. I'm always open for discussion.
