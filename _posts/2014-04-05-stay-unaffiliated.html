<p>I recently found out about this guy named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saul_Alinsky">Saul Alinsky</a>. If you don't know about him, he was a political activist in the 50s and 60s who wanted to improve American ghettos. He published 2 books, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0679721134/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0679721134&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=radhimorab0c-20">Rules for Radicals</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0679721126/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0679721126&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=radhimorab0c-20">Reveille for Radicals</a>. He's an absolute genius and his tactics have been used all over, even as far as the Obama Administration, which is why if you look up Saul Alinsky on Amazon, the books beyond his own are those from commentators of today about Obama.</p>
<p>This just proves how amazing Alinsky is. He was controversial in his own time, and he's still considered controversial today. That is the mark of someone who's important.</p>
<p>I admire Alinsky, from whatever I've read on Wikipedia, so I bought two books--his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0679721134/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0679721134&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=radhimorab0c-20">Rules for Radicals</a>, and the most famous biography on him, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/067973418X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=067973418X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=radhimorab0c-20">Let Them Call Me Rebel</a>. If I like these two books, and eventually, Alinsky, then I'll fall down the rabbit hole and find every book I can about him.</p>
<p>Alinsky had an interview with Playboy in 1972, very close to his death. You can read the whole thing <a href="http://www.progress.org/tpr/interview-with-saul-alinsky/">here</a>, but there was one specific part that struck me the most.</p>
<blockquote><p>PLAYBOY: Did you consider becoming a party member prior to the Nazi-Soviet Pact?</p>
<p>ALINSKY: Not at any time. I’ve never joined any organization — not even the ones I’ve organized myself. I prize my own independence too much. And philosophically, I could never accept any rigid dogma or ideology, whether it’s Christianity or Marxism. One of the most important things in life is what judge Learned Hand described as “that ever-gnawing inner doubt as to whether you’re right.” If you don’t have that, if you think you’ve got an inside track to absolute truth, you become doctrinaire, humorless and intellectually constipated. The greatest crimes in history have been perpetrated by such religious and political and racial fanatics, from the persecutions of the Inquisition on down to Communist purges and Nazi genocide. The great atomic physicist Niels Bohr summed it up pretty well when he said, “Every sentence I utter must be understood not as an affirmation, but as a question.” Nobody owns the truth, and dogma, whatever form it takes, is the ultimate enemy of human freedom.</p>
<p>Now, this doesn’t mean that I’m rudderless; I think I have a much keener sense of direction and purpose than the true believer with his rigid ideology, because I’m free to be loose, resilient and independent, able to respond to any situation as it arises without getting trapped by articles of faith. <b>My only fixed truth is a belief in people, a conviction that if people have the opportunity to act freely and the power to control their own destinies, they’ll generally reach the right decisions.</b> The only alternative to that belief is rule by an elite, whether it’s a Communist bureaucracy or our own present-day corporate establishment. You should never have an ideology more specific than that of the founding fathers: “For the general welfare.” That’s where I parted company with the Communists in the Thirties, and that’s where I stay parted from them today.</p></blockquote>
<p>It's so odd. You think of activists, or people who change the world, and most of them are heavily involved in their own party (or the equivalent of a party, like a religion).</p>
<p>Saul Alinsky wanted liberal democracy, but he wasn't part of the liberal or the democratic party. Why? <strong>Because no organization will ever align exactly with your individual goals.</strong></p>
<p>Even the ones you make yourself are susceptible to outgrow you. As the organization gets bigger, the founder's personal goals are no longer big enough to fulfill the organization. There's an advisory board, and even if you're one member, you can't control all of them. The only thing you have complete control over is yourself.</p>
<p>Alinsky had his own agenda, and that agenda required complete freedom. He could never be sure that his own goals wouldn't conflict with various affiliations, so he stayed away from them all.</p>
<p>It's something to think about, at the very least. I, for one, am very adamant about having strong opinions and strong affiliations, but maybe it's better to have strong opinions, but have your only affiliation be towards yourself.</p>
