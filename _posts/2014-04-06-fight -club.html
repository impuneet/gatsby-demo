<p>[<i>NOTE: Obviously, spoilers are ahead.</i>]</p>
<p>I read Fight Club a few weeks back. This is a book that changed lives. If you go on any forum, you'll find a Tyler Durden. So many sites have a quote from Fight Club as a tagline. Everyone knows the Fight Club rules by heart. The movie went on to become a cult classic, and has an 8.9 rating on IMDb. Fight Club is a modern classic, and everyone has at least heard of the name.</p>
<p>My response to all that after reading it? Eh...</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong. It's a beautiful book. Chuck Palahniuk is such a good writer. I only breathed between chapters, it was so intense.</p>
<p>Let me talk about this more. Each chapter is an average of 5 pages. They're short, and the general format goes like this--First, we end up with some sort of wacky result. The main character is being hugged by this man with a chest like a woman, or the main character's boss finds the Fight Club rules and confronts him about it. Then, we unfurl how we reached this point, and finally, the last page or two concludes the event.</p>
<p>In fact, the whole book goes like this. We begin at the climax, and the next 200 pages explains how we got there. Then, we're back, and we have a totally different perspective on the whole thing. Clarity rushes in.</p>
<p>It's a short book as well, totaling 208 pages, which I read over the course of 3 days. It's very readable, because the short chapters leave you wanting more. Your brain doesn't exhaust like with the 30-page chapters which are the norm. The 5 or so is so short, that you go, "What's the harm in another chapter?"</p>
<p>The narrative doesn't go step-by-step, guiding you along. It's a series of events that somehow, actually quite brilliantly, link together for total harmony. There's never any confusion, and although we skip days, months, maybe even years, it flows in a gorgeous manner.</p>
<p>So, I loved the book, but it didn't change my life.</p>
<p>Fight Club goes into anti-consumerism, anti-authoritarianism, independence, and related themes. I found it to be extremely relevant to 2014, although it's 18 years old. It's still modern. The book would've only been mildly different with the addition of today's social media and the metrics which come with that.</p>
<p>The thing is, I'm already all about that. It was nice to hear things I already agree with put into such a coherent and jarring fashion. But, I only highlighted 7 quotes. Supposedly, the movie dives deeper into this, and ignores that Tyler isn't the hero of this story. (I'm yet to see it.)</p>
<p>All of these themes and quotes and "Yeah, Tyler!" got downplayed a lot when we found out that Tyler was the antagonist of the story. Maybe I'm the only one who thought so, but I always liked the narrator better than Tyler. It makes me question, are Tyler's answers true anymore? It gets pretty intense, and I found myself highlighting less the further on we got in the book because Tyler gets very extreme and is no longer trustworthy.</p>
<p>Why did the narrator create Tyler in the first place? The obvious answer is that you can't control your split personality, it's a mental disease. But we liked Tyler. The narrator liked Tyler. The narrator admired Tyler.</p>
<p>I believe that Tyler was created because that's what the narrator wanted all along. Tyler was handsome (or we can assume that he was), charming, confident, smart, driven, and he got a lot done.</p>
<p>The narrator got so frustrated with his life that he created Tyler. Tyler had been building up inside of him for so long, and then Tyler got out of control.</p>
<p>I still don't know what to think of Tyler. Is he the anti-hero? But he was wrong. The space monkey weren't original or independent, they did everything Tyler said. They were just the manpower for Tyler's project. Tyler didn't really care about any of them. He got all the glory in the end, with men everywhere calling him "Sir."</p>
<p>In this society, which is modern America, surviving is easy. I don't think there was a recession back then, so Tyler had a few jobs and got by. He didn't buy stuff and approached a lot of necessities with a DIY mindset, like the Paper Street Soap Company. He was surviving, and beyond that, he was comfortable. Once you reach comfort and satisfaction with your lifestyle, you start to want more. Tyler wanted fame and he wanted to go down in history.</p>
<p>We've all wanted that. I wanted that. Every time I picked up a new sport or hobby, I imagined making it pro. I would go on to be a pro basketball player, or I'd sing and play guitar in a famous band, or go on to be a New York Times Bestselling Author. Yes, it's embarrassing, but we've all wanted it at one point or another.</p>
<p>Was it right, though? Was Tyler correct? At a minimum, I knew that his path to comfort and satisfaction was right. Own little and don't get attached to anything. The DIY was good, I guess, but it's time or money, and I hope to do greater things with my time than make my own soap.</p>
<p>Beyond that, where did he go wrong? Where did Tyler stop telling the truth of the world? His words always struck a chord, but at one point, I hesitated to go "Yeah! Tyler!"</p>
<p>I don't know the answers to these questions, but I think they're good questions. Fight Club is at least worth another read, I might have interpreted the whole thing the wrong way.</p>
