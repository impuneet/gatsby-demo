It was May of 2014. We'd just received a call saying I officially failed school. They were being nice and just counting it as if I wasn't enrolled for the whole semester. It was as if the dozens of hours I spent worrying and attempting to catch up counted for nothing.

Growing up, I was a good student. I got As, and at worst, Bs. I joined the GATE program when I was 8 (you take an IQ test and if you score high enough, you join a special program that looks good on paper, but generally does nothing.), I was in all honors in middle school, I was in as many APs (Advanced Placement, or college-level courses) as I could be in high school, eventually reaching 4 APs in my Junior year. I was on track to go to one of the top 30 universities in the US.

Things took a turn in November of 2011 (my Freshman year of high school), when I overextended myself and basically destroyed my lower half. Thanks to incompetent, judgmental doctors and my own denial, I let it get worse and worse until I had to leave school. I began to be in and of alternative schools, sometimes heading back to my normal high school because I could never understand the alternative schools. In the end, though, I was at a seemingly perfect alternative program, and I finally failed.

There were no other options in front of me. We tried every alternative program that would guarantee a normal high school diploma, and I just couldn't do it. Finally, when I failed, I gave up. I said I was dropping out of school, including skipping college.

I'd been involved in the alternative online world for years now, and saw plenty of normal people, just like me, doing jobs that never asked for any kind of formal credential. I knew I could do it, so I'd been studying web development for the past few months. I would eventually drop that and pursue freelance marketing, which leads us to where I am today.

But, my parents wouldn't let me drop out so easily. It was fine if I wanted to pursue work, but what if that failed without a formal degree? I needed some kind of backup plan.

So, I decided to do the bare minimum it took to graduate. I finally completed that a few weeks ago, with a total investment of less than 10 hours of work.

Don't believe me? Take a look at my fancy certificate:

That's right. **I'm officially a high school dropout _and_ a graduate.** I'm also making enough money to live on without ever mentioning my formal credentials, which is the whole reason people get a degree, right?

If you or someone you know is considering dropping out of high school, I believe I've now been on this path long enough to offer some advice.

**NOTE:** Everything mentioned here only applies to the US, and if you want to get specific, to California. Look up your own laws and alternatives, I only know what works for where I live.

# How to Drop Out of High School

## Step 1: Why do you want to drop out of high school?

You seriously need to ask yourself why you want to drop out.

Is it because of some social issues you'd rather run away from? Is it because you feel like you're working towards no gain? Is there a better opportunity waiting for you that school is keeping you from?

With most of these problems, there's alternatives to dropping out entirely. You can transfer schools, you can take easier classes, you can join an alternative school, etc..

If your problem is that you think the system is working against you and you're just not good at school, remember that when you leave school, you're entering the workforce. Being in school can serve as a great default option as you're building your skills, network, or business. Once you drop out, you're expected to get out there and make your own money.

[Ryan Holiday](http://thoughtcatalog.com/ryan-holiday/2014/04/should-i-drop-out-of-college/), one of the poster children of dropout success, says this on the subject: "Have you fully taken advantage of the unique opportunities that are offered to students? Because let me tell you, the world is much kinder to students. The second you leave youâ€™re now _competition_."

Are you sure you're ready to compete with people with degrees who used school to easily get internships and gain experience? As much as you hate school, you can still dip your toes into the workforce while still having financial support from your parents.

Unlike college, there is no going back to high school. Sure, you can always get your GED, but a GED is still looked down upon in comparison to getting a real, state-issued high school diploma.

In order to justify dropping out entirely, you need to do your research and confirm that there is absolutely no other option. Run your options and reasoning over with your parents, your friends, and other people you respect. They'll point out the flaws in your reasoning quickly. Listen to them, but remember, they've either made their fortune on the safe path or are betting that they will, so take what they say with a grain of salt.

If you want someone who's been down this path to think critically with you, [feel free to get in contact with me](http://rmorabia.com). I'd love to help you out.

## Step 2: Find alternatives.

In 99% of cases, you won't need to drop out of high school entirely. The US is obsessed with their drop out rates and offer a ton of options that can work with your constraints and wishes.

There's online school, there's alternative schools, there's independent study programs, or there's what I eventually took--an exam. Look this up in your own state, but this is how I graduated from high school:

I was initially thrust into everything listed above. I was in an independent study program with my local high school, I then joined online school, and I was finally in an alternative school. Along the way, I went back and tried some of these methods twice, and even went back to my local high school as a normal student. None of it worked.

When I decided to drop out, I thought I was going to take the GED. Instead, I scoured around and a friend told me about the [CHSPE](http://chspe.net).

I spent a few hours reading up on it and talking to people about it. It was a test that would give a high school-equivalent diploma. It isn't a real diploma, but in most cases, it would be treated as the same thing. I could definitely go to college with this thing, which was the only reason I wanted a diploma.

I bought a prep book, took a practice test, and passed that. I promised myself I'd study more just in case, but I honestly didn't because I was building up my business instead.

In the middle of my [6 weeks of bedrest](http://rmorabia.com/bedrest), I went and took the test at a local high school. I was sick and tired, so I rushed through it and got out an hour early.

I waited a month, and then I got an email with the results. I passed. The above diploma came in the mail a few days later.

That was it. I'm a high school graduate, now.

That method worked for me because I like tests a lot more than work, and I was in quite advanced classes while I was attending school. The test was on subjects I passed in middle school.

Testing out might not be for you. Your problem with school might be test anxiety sabotaging your grades. Then, you might want to look into alternative schools. The school I failed from was entirely work-based. You do the work at home, show up 2x a week and turn your work in, and you might have to take a few tests, but nowhere near the amount you take in normal school. It sounds like heaven for a lot of people, but I'm just so much more of a test person.

Or, you might want to travel. You might have an opportunity to go abroad for 6 months with that non-profit you got involved with a few years ago. You don't need to drop out, just enroll in online school. You can take the same classes as normal school. My online school was free, public, and I took all the APs I normally would.

There's so many options. Before you drop out entirely, talk to your school counselor, talk to other people, search the government websites, and you'll find a lot. Don't glaze over any option because you've been in the default system for so long. It's entirely possible to get a degree without slaving in school for 8+ hours a day.

## Step 3: What's your plan?

Now that you know there are alternatives... What next? What do you plan to do with your extra time? Are you just going to sit at home and play video games? I love video games, too, but you're dropping out for something bigger, right?

If you don't already have a plan, check out [Charlie Hoehn's free guide titled Recession-Proof Graduate](http://guides.co/guide/the-recession-proof-graduate). Read it long before you drop out to help you figure out your plan and to give you a method to jumpstart your way to achieving that plan.

You also need to figure out some adult things. Figure out where you're going to make money, where you want to stay (it's okay to live with your parents for a while as long as you're working towards something), what you have to do if you still want to go to college, etc..

This will take much longer than a few hours or even a weekend. I've been alternative since 2012 and I finally took the dropout path in May, but I'm still working towards finding the answers to these questions myself. It will take a while, and you'll have to figure out a lot as you go.

## Step 4: Ignore the naysayers.

Above, I said to listen to feedback from your parents, friends, and people you trust in your life.

There is a very big difference between feedback and negativity.

It's good to have unbiased views in your life that call you out when you're about to make mistakes. But, that's the key word, unbiased.

Everyone is biased. I'm biased towards self-education and the alternative path, while your parents who both got PhDs from respected universities are entirely biased towards success through the traditional path.

If you're going down the alternative path, some people will get offended and think of it as a personal attack on themselves. Others won't understand at all because they're only around people who have achieved great success through the traditional path. Some people are just plain negative and bitter. There's no pleasing them.

Remember, you don't live to please them. [You live to please yourself.](http://rmorabia.com/17)

You really need to draw the line between what feedback that will help you is and feedback that will hurt you is. You need feedback and support, but you can't let irrelevant strangers influence your decisions.

It's difficult, but here's how I've done it:

* Create a list of people you want to be like and about them specifically you'd like to emulate.
* Ask them for advice about your plan, but only ask questions that fit into what about them you want to emulate. Be as specific as possible.

Anyone who you never want to be like should not be taken seriously, except as an example of what to never do. Even if someone you respect gives you advice, unless there's a specific trait you'd like to emulate from them, just toss that advice out.

Also, remember, asking people about what made them successful in their time is probably irrelevant to how you can achieve that today.

You need to look at every piece of advice with a critical eye. That doesn't mean you shouldn't ask for loads of advice. I've sent the most generic, desperate emails at 1AM and gotten life-changing advice from both one-line responses and long essays in response. It's so worth it.

## Step 5: Do it, or don't.

Every person who reads this post and takes the time to think through each step will reach a different conclusion here. Some of you will decide you should just stick it out in school. Others are going to drop out of school (or join an alternative program), and then head to college. People like me will do the bare minimum to get college acceptance if needed, and want all the time in the world to develop themselves, their network, and their skills.

If you learned anything from this post, hopefully, it's that there are a ton of alternatives to dropping out completely that are actually much easier to do.

If you've done something very cool and alternative, please [email me](http://rmorabia.com/contact) tell me about it. I'm always looking to meet other ambitious alternative types.

If you want be an ambitious alternative type and don't know what to do, [email me as well](http://rmorabia.com/contact). I'd love to help you out and point you in the right direction.
