<p>Imagine you're a native of one of the biggest cities of your whole world, Tenochtitlan. Your nation is prosperous, large, and technologically advanced. Up until Hernán Cortés comes up and ruins the party, that is.</p>
<p>There are three reasons why your home was mercilessly destroyed:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The enemies have superior tech. </strong>This is the standard answer that most people think of in regards to the Native Americans. Although the Aztecs were incredibly advanced, they couldn't even invent the wheel.</li>
<li><strong>You were too trusting. </strong>Your leader, Montezuma, thought that Hernán was a god, Quetzalcoatl. You showered him with so much gold that he destroyed your entire empire.</li>
<li><strong>You have no resistance to the Spanish diseases.</strong> This killed off 90% of natives across the Americas. There was no resistance in your body because you'd never been exposed to it before.</li>
</ol>
<p>You may still think we're imaging. Guess what? We're not.</p>
<p>You are an Aztec, and there are plenty of Hernán Cortés' out there to try and plunder your gold in exchange for your life.</p>
<p>Welcome to the New-New World, the cyberworld.</p>
<p>I'm perfectly aware that the internet has been around for 20 years+, but it also took Hernán and his crew 25 years after Columbus' landing to pillage the Aztecs.</p>
<p>Just as these 25 years were left for exploration and documentation, these past 20 years were a series of experiments. People put their first products online, people uploaded movies to the web, people are making entire livings off of the internet, and people have created multi-billion dollar companies from the internet.</p>
<p>But now, Hernán Cortés and his crew are taking over. As part of the masses, you're simply waiting to get controlled, scammed, and used for illicit activity.</p>
<p>There are a couple of things that you need to understand before I can properly inform you on how to combat this. If you don't understand why you need to combat this, then you'll continue on your life believing that you're safe.</p>
<p><strong>You're not.</strong></p>
<h1>3 Things You Need to Understand About the Web</h1>
<h1><span style="line-height: 1.6;">#1: Everything is permanent.</span></h1>
<p>Let's say you're doing something bad. This could be illegal, or you could just be flirting with your boyfriend's best friend.</p>
<p>If you talked about it on Facebook, even through Private Message--guess what, you're screwed. Deleted your account or deleted the messages? Facebook still has it, and <a href="http://newsroom.fb.com/News/699/Global-Government-Requests-Report">Facebook will give the data to the government</a> or your boyfriend.</p>
<p>Doesn't feel relevant? Let's say you got wasted the night of your high school graduation and someone uploaded a picture of you doing so. Even if you un-tag yourself or ask them to take it down, <em><strong>it's still there, forever</strong>.</em></p>
<p>What if you do <em></em>nothing <em></em>bad? You're a goody-goody and your record is extremely clean. None of this is going to harm you.</p>
<p>I want to show you something. You have a Google account, right? I bet your email address ends in @gmail.com and your homepage is google.com. Google, and anyone who knows your password can <a href="https://history.google.com/history/">see every single thing you've ever searched for and every single link you clicked from it</a>.</p>
<p>If that doesn't creep you out, I don't know what will. When I found this out and looked through everything, I found a couple of searches that were made when someone was logged into my account. They were...interesting, in the least.</p>
<p>As a personal way to end this, <a href="http://www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=radhika13101">here's something from when I was 7</a>.</p>
<h2>#2: Closed is bad, open is good.</h2>
<p>First of all, what's closed and open on the web?</p>
<p>Closed services are like Apple, Google, Facebook--pretty much everything you use by default.</p>
<p>Most people have iPhones or at least know how one works, correct? When you're trying to download a new song, why aren't you able to directly from a site like <a href="http://bandcamp.com">Bandcamp</a> or the musician's site? Why do you have to go on a computer, plug in your USB drive, download the song onto the computer, drag it into buggy iTunes, pray it doesn't explode, and wait for it to sync?</p>
<p>Meanwhile, with <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/os/">Firefox OS</a>, you can download whatever you want without the computer.</p>
<p>I never had an iPhone, but for my 14th birthday, I got an iPod Nano. Every time I wanted to download new music, I had to use iTunes, which is such a pain. Luckily, it stopped working after nearly two years (what a waste of $160) and I got the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002MAPT7U/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002MAPT7U&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=radhimorab0c-20">Sandisk Sansa Clip</a>, with at least twice the space for $100 less.</p>
<p>This uses a drag-and-drop interface like plugging in a USB drive, supports virtually all audio file formats, and allows for you to expanded to up to 72GB with the use of a microSD card.</p>
<p>That is open.</p>
<p>Wordpress, the software I'm using to relay this information towards you, is open. The theme I'm using on this website is open. <a href="https://www.videolan.org/vlc/">The best media player ever is open</a>.</p>
<p>By coincidence, all of the software I mentioned above are open source (meaning that if you want to see the exact code that went into the application, you can) and they're free, but open doesn't have to mean free.</p>
<p>So yes, if you're a content creator, you can earn money from your content, but it can still be open. (See <a href="http://sublimetext.com">Sublime Text Editor</a> as an example.)</p>
<h2><strong>#3: You're being censored.</strong></h2>
<p>More than hardcore porn and terrorist allegations, real people trying to get across real messages of change can get censored very easily.</p>
<p>If you're trying to rally change that Facebook doesn't like, and you're using Facebook to get this message across, Facebook can shut you down whenever they want.</p>
<p>This seems logical, right? Facebook's a company, they can do what they want.</p>
<p>But as an activist, you wonder--how else can I get people's attention if not through Facebook?</p>
<p>Is that what we've come to? Relying on closed systems to relay our messages?</p>
<p>I have a website, which means that I have a much better chance at getting my message across. Wordpress is open, which means it won't stop me from saying whatever I want. The only thing that may stop me is my hosting provider, <a href="http://siteground.com">Siteground</a>, but the chance of that happening is much less than if I was writing this on Facebook. (Note: <a href="www.riseup.net/en/radical-servers">There are web hosting providers if you are doing something a bit fishy.</a> I only use Siteground because it's cheap.)</p>
<p>Even if you're not trying to change the world, you could get censored for just about anything. If you've ever been banned from a forum (throwback to the early 2000's), you know what I mean.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/free-speech-weak-link">If you want more information on this, EFF is great at explaining things.</a></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>If by now, you're not frantically searching for a solution, people are better at spreading the problem to the masses than me:</p>

</ul>
<p>By now, you're at least a little bit concerned about your privacy and your rights, right? I hope so.</p>
<h1>15 Steps to Regaining Your Rights Online</h1>
<p>Let me clear something up, before you start to doubt me again. I am not a tech guru. I know HTML, I know how to torrent, and I know that viruses don't cause all of computer's problems. Everything I'm about to advise below is coming from a fellow not-too-techy person. You can be assured that everything is pretty easy to do. If you have any troubles, email me at <a href="mailto:hi@rmorabia.com">hi@rmorabia.com</a> and I'll see what I can do to help.</p>
<p>The list below goes in steps from easiest to hardest. Don't do everything at once. Some steps will take a long time to complete. I still haven't finished all 15. Once you do, however, you'll be a lot safer than the masses, and you can move on to stuff like <a href="http://hidemyass.com">HideMyAss</a> and <a href="http://hyperboria.net">Hyperboria</a>. <a href="http://evbogue.com">Ev Bogue's got you covered after this.</a></p>
<h2>#1: Stop searching with Google.</h2>
<p>DuckDuckGo, which is an alternative to Google, has some fancy websites that illustrate the issue with Google/Bing/Yahoo! with more eloquence than I possess:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://dontbubble.us">DontBubble.Us</a> - all about the creepy filter bubble that keeps you biased.</li>
<li><a href="http://donttrack.us">DontTrack.Us</a> - see the web history issue above.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are alternatives, and yes, they are as good as Google Search.</p>
<p><a href="https://duckduckgo.com">DuckDuckGo</a> is based off of Yahoo!, and is the most popular alternative. It has a nice UI and allows for the fancy shortcut searches that Google has.</p>
<p>If you need, need, need the Google algorithms, <a href="http://startpage.com">Startpage</a> has you covered. It's based off of Google, but has none of the creepy privacy issues.</p>
<p>This is the easiest step out of the 15. Both sites offer easy ways to add them to your browser, and you should be set. Not using Google Search is the easiest way to protect yourself, trust me.</p>
<h2>#2: Get off of Gmail.</h2>
<p>Although Gmail has a nice UI, it is not safe, at all. Like the above Facebook example, Google can choose to not let your emails go through, or not let people's emails reach you.</p>
<p>Second, the service isn't as free as you think. Ads are littered everywhere and Google reads your emails to tailor the ads accordingly.</p>
<p>There's an easier, ad-free option, <a href="http://hushmail.com">Hushmail</a>. As you can probably tell, I use it myself. <a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2007/11/encrypted-e-mai/">It's not totally safe for privacy</a>, but it's the easiest and most reliable option that doesn't require massive tech skills. If you're sending anything you only want one person to read, there's a super easy encryption option embedded in the UI.</p>
<p>You'll notice that you only get 25MB free, which some people might find appalling. I've been under that constraint for a few months now without trouble. If you need extra space and want to support a company doing good things (think of the 25MB as a trial), pay $50 a year.</p>
<p>Google's coaxed us all into believing everything should be free. When you're not the customer, you're the product. Pay for your stuff if you get a regular paycheck.</p>
<h2>#3: Uninstall Google Chrome.</h2>
<p>First of all, fanboys, Google Chrome is not the fastest browser around. Clearly, that's Firefox.</p>
<p>Second, having a Google browser is the easiest way to be sold . They can track every single thing you do now, with or without using their other products.</p>
<p>Also, the bandwidth that Chrome requires slows downloads, the UI is terrible, and it's another closed system.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/">Just switch to Firefox already</a>.</p>
<p>If you're feeling very fancy, <a href="https://www.torproject.org">try switching to Tor</a>. It isn't that complicated, but it's much safer.</p>
<p>Note: If you're using Tor, don't do multi-media. It'll be too slow and complicated. Save that for Firefox.</p>
<h2>#4: Stop using the rest of Google's products.</h2>
<p>Hands down, Google sucks. Google has taken over our lives into this Brave New World mindset. It's really creepy. Delete your account as soon as you've safely moved all of your important stuff elsewhere.</p>
<p>I'm still in the process of this. I have a couple of emails I still need, so my old Google account is still in place. I know the effects of this, and I know how difficult this is. It's important, though.</p>
<p>Note: We know that nothing gets deleted. The point of deleting your Google account is to make sure no future data is collected.</p>
<p>Most of the products Google makes us rely on have better alternatives. You can find a <a href="http://prism-break.org">mega-list along with other privacy-sucking companies here</a>.</p>
<h2>#5: Install Adblock, Disconnect, HTTPS Everywhere, and NoScript.</h2>
<p>These are a couple of safety add-ons for Firefox. For Tor, you don't need to download any add-ons.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://adblockplus.org/en/firefox">Adblock Plus</a> - as the name suggests, it blocks ads. It does, however, display ethical ads, such as <a href="https://www.projectwonderful.com">Project Wonderful</a> and <a href="http://reddit.com">Reddit</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.disconnect.me/">Disconnect</a> - requests come in all the time from advertisers, trackers, and social networks. Disconnect blocks you from these.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere">HTTPS Everywhere</a> - this add-on attempts to make all connections secure, if the site allows it. Otherwise, when you're inputting information, it's easier for hackers to get it.</li>
<li><a href="http://noscript.net/">NoScript</a> - this acts as alongside Disconnect, and it blocks scripts. I recommend turning off scripts globally, and turning them on temporarily if needed. When using NoScript, the most secure sites will come up with only one request--the domain name. Mine comes up with two. I'm working on that.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these add-ons will increase your privacy and safety on the web, though at the same time, they'll probably make your browsing experience faster. It's a win-win.</p>
<h2>#6: Switch to HTML5.</h2>
<p><a href="http://flashsucks.org/">Adobe Flash sucks.</a> If you're an online gamer like I am, you're screwed. But most of us only use Flash to watch YouTube and Vimeo videos. Lucky for you, both offer HTML5 options.</p>
<p>HTML5 is basically a better, faster, more efficient, safer, and overall more awesome framework for Flash-like applications.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/html5">Here's the page to make YouTube HTML5.</a></p>
<p>Vimeo's player should automatically switch to HTML5 once you uninstall Flash (from the desktop. It isn't an add-on).</p>
<h2>#7: Use RSS.</h2>
<p>Stop using Twitter or Facebook to keep up with your favorite web sites. On Facebook, if you want your message to reach everyone who has liked your page, you have to pay. You could be missing tons of important messages from the organizations you're involved in.</p>
<p>There are a ton of open RSS feed readers. I use <a href="http://theoldreader.com">The Old Reader</a>, which is undergoing some identity issues right now, but <a href="https://www.newsblur.com/">NewsBlur</a> is open. I'm thinking about switching soon.</p>
<p>Again, note that NewsBlur has a premium option. This isn't evil. It's simply a sustainability strategy. That means NewsBlur won't be going away like Google Reader.</p>
<p>If RSS is too technical for you, most sites now have email lists. <a href="http://mad.ly/signups/103121/join">I do, too.</a> If, however, your favorite site doesn't have an email newsletter, you can use an <a href="http://blogtrottr.com/">RSS to email service</a>.</p>
<h2>#8: Stop using Dropbox, SkyDrive, etc.</h2>
<p>This is where your most personal data lies. Pictures, letters, documents, music, etc. This is very important to keep safe. Yet, you're keeping it in a place that can hand it over to the government or anyone very, very easily.</p>
<p>Meet <a href="https://spideroak.com/download/referral/3379526fb517382716ff5112a4e3ed48">SpiderOak</a>. (Yes, that is an affiliate link. I don't get paid, I just get extra space for free if you sign up through there. If you don't like affiliate links 2500 words down this page, it's the name of the company + .com.)</p>
<p>The cool thing about SpiderOak is the safety involved. It's almost impossible for anyone who wants your data to get access to it.</p>
<p>They participate in something called Zero-Knowledge Privacy. <a href="https://spideroak.com/faq/category/privacy__passwords/">Here's a bit more about it.</a></p>
<p>I highly, highly, highly recommend switching over to SpiderOak. You get as much space as your free Dropbox account anyway, and the pricing plan for upgraded space is highly affordable ($100 a year for virtually unlimited data storage).</p>
<h2>#9: Delete your Facebook.</h2>
<p>Ooh, this is a toughie. Everyone's on Facebook. Life is on Facebook. How will I survive without Facebook?</p>
<p>As a student, this is definitely apparent. If you don't have a Facebook as a student, you're kind of weird. Group projects revolve around Facebook Groups or Private Messages. You ask other students what the homework wa when you miss it on Facebook. Clubs relay most of their information through groups. I'm the President of a club, so I relay my information through Facebook, too. <a href="http://facebook.com/radhikamorabia">I still haven't tackled this, even though I know how important it is.</a> (Don't add me, that was just to show I haven't deleted my Facebook.)</p>
<p>People look you up on Facebook. It's your whole identity.</p>
<p>That's pretty scary.</p>
<p>Your whole identity relies on a closed company that is floating because of tailored advertisements.</p>
<p>If that's not reason enough to think about deleting your Facebook, know that they track you everywhere where a Facebook Like button is present. Since everyone's trying to garner traffic from Facebook, that's essentially every website on the internet. (This is also why I've disabled sharing buttons on my site. If you want to share, you know how.)</p>
<p>If you can't delete your Facebook yet, at least use it consciously. Being addicted to Facebook has its own psychological consequences since everyone's putting up their best self online.</p>
<h2>#10: Get a website.</h2>
<p>If someone's searching for you and all they find are Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Tumblr, and Pinterest, none of what they see is really in your control.</p>
<p>You're limited by that closed company's design and that closed company's data input.</p>
<p>Even if you're already employed or not looking for new employment, I still highly recommend getting a FirstNameLastName.com.</p>
<p>You don't have to blog like I do or try and do anything with your website, but at least get a simple landing page up. <a href="http://john.do/free-branding-templates/">Here's a couple of free templates</a>. Nothing fancy, just a picture, a bio, and links to where you're more relevant.</p>
<p>If you think you have to be a tech genius, you don't. <a href="http://www.siteground.com/friends.htm?referrer_id=6953256">Get one year of hosting for $10 here.</a> You also receive a free domain. All that means is that you get the whole website deal for $10 for the first year. (Yes, that's another affiliate link. Like before, I don't get paid, I just get an extra month of hosting for free. This time, however, the deal only comes if you sign up through a referral link. If you want to go to companyname.com, it'll cost you $50 per year to get started.)</p>
<p>Then, search around for some free templates, edit a bit, and leave it to stand. <a href="http://enwil.com/services/">If you want someone to do this part for you, Manish Suwal is offering very affordable website setup.</a></p>
<h2>#11: Switch to Linux.</h2>
<p>First of all, if you're using a Chromebook, get off my site.</p>
<p>Now, if you're using Mac or Windows, let's talk about Linux. You've probably heard of it before. If not, I assure you that you've used it before. It won't track you or ruin your life, like Mac/Windows do.</p>
<p>Linux is free, open, and as functional (if not more) than your OS. It's awesome and everyone should switch.</p>
<p>The best part about Linux is that you can download any distro (individual operating system) that fits your needs.</p>
<p>If you're a basic person who does pretty basic things, I recommend <a href="http://www.linuxmint.com/">Linux Mint</a>.</p>
<p>If you're sharing a computer and you can't totally switch over to Linux, <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/install-ubuntu-with-windows">Ubuntu offers to dual-boot</a>, which means that when you turn on your computer, you can choose whether to open up Ubuntu or Windows.</p>
<p>There are hundreds, if not thousands, of other Linux distros out there, though. These two are simply the most appealing to the average users. If you want to find one that's most relevant to you, check out <a href="http://distrowatch.com/">DistroWatch</a>.</p>
<p>Note: If you're a gamer, you're probably screwed.</p>
<h2>#12: Sell your Apple Products.</h2>
<p>iPhone, no. Do you know how Google gets its live traffic data for Google Maps? It tracks you. I bet plenty of other things on your phone tracks.</p>
<p>Mac, no. This OS has no functionality whatsoever. If you argue with me, you're too young to remember Windows XP.</p>
<p>Sure, their design is nice, but their functionality lacks. You're paying a premium for a product made for someone lacking the intelligence. If the closed systems don't bother you at all (iTunes, the beach ball, etc.), you can keep on using your trash. Meanwhile, I'll be content without my iPhone.</p>
<p>As I said before with the Sansa Clip MP3 player, there are alternatives for a fraction of the price. You just have to go looking for them.</p>
<h2>#13: Use IRC.</h2>
<p>IRC is an open chatting service. Better than iMessage, better than AIM, better than Facebook Mesages, IRC doesn't save a thing unless you're in a channel that specifically says they log (eg. support channels for various softwares).</p>
<p>Right now, getting on IRC is easy. You can go to <a href="http://kiwiirc.com">kiwiirc.com</a> and log into any channel you want. Invite your friends to that channel, and all they have to do is enter in their nickname and the channel you designated.</p>
<p>The cool thing about IRC is that you can use it anywhere. It's open. If you don't want to use Kiwi's web client, download <a href="http://pidgin.im">Pidgin</a> for the desktop or various clients for your mobile device. (The server for Kiwi is irc.rizon.net.)</p>
<p>It's much easier to get your friends on when they don't have to sign up.</p>
<p>Note: If you use Skype, stop that, too. Skype is easily tracked and you are not safe on it.</p>
<h2>#14: Learn HTML/CSS.</h2>
<p>If you don't know how to put up a simple website or communicate without pressing the buttons at the top of the screen, you're in no control of your own words. HTML is very easy to learn and CSS is very easy to learn.</p>
<p>It's not going to take too long. If it takes over a month of one hour a day, I'd be shocked. I'd teach you myself, then.</p>
<p>Simple way: <a href="http://design.evbogue.com/">get a product</a>.</p>
<p>Bit harder way: <a href="https://www.utexas.edu/learn/html/">go through some web resources</a>.</p>
<p>Note: Please don't use W3schools.</p>
<h2>#15: Read the Terms and Conditions/Privacy Policy of every service you use.</h2>
<p>You have no clue what Facebook, Google, etc., are taking from you when you sign up, do you?</p>
<p>They could be asking you for slave labor and you couldn't know it, because you checked the box without reading the terms and conditions.</p>
<p>Every time you sign up for a new service, try with all of your might to read the TaC/PP. If you don't want to read it, don't sign up. It's that simple.</p>
<p>There's a cool site that's coming up that offers to make the Terms of Service easier to read. It's called <a href="http://tosdr.org">TOS;DR</a>. Right now, the offerings are limited, but it'll definitely help you decide with Facebook.</p>
<h2>BONUS #1: Check the monetization strategy for every service you use.</h2>
<p>Cool! New startup! Tumblr! Instagram! Free! No ads!</p>
<p>Ask yourself--how is this service making money? How is this company going to sustain itself? Every service is a company. Don't act shocked when Instagram gets acquired by Facebook and turns to ruins. Instagram didn't have a monetization strategy, and now, if you're a heavy Instagram user, you're screwed.</p>
<p>Only sign up for services with monetization strategies you believe in. Services that require you to pay a monthly, yearly, or one-time fee are the most sustainable. Other services rely on ads, and if you're okay with their advertising principles, go for it.</p>
<p>If the service looks totally free and there's no monetization strategy visible, run away. It's either going to die out or it will get snatched by a company you don't like.</p>
<h2>BONUS #2: Read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591846285/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1591846285&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=radhimorab0c-20">Trust Me I'm Lying: Confessions of a Media Manipulator by Ryan Holiday</a>.</h2>
<p>All of the above is for tacking the faceless evils of our time. There are, however, faces who are trying to garner your attention and money. Ryan Holiday is an expert at media manipulation, marketing for names you probably know: Tucker Max, Tim Ferriss, Robert Greene, and American Apparel. (Those are just the ones who are public about their affiliation with Ryan.)</p>
<p>This book brings awareness to how the media works, and how you as a consumer can stop getting fed lies and trash. Fight the media with awareness.</p>
<h2>BONUS #3: DO NOT BUY GOOGLE GLASS.</h2>
<p>Please. If you do nothing on this list, please don't buy Google Glass. With Google Glass, you're not only letting your own privacy go away, you're taking away mine.</p>
<p>As of right now, nobody has a tangible image of my lazy outfits at school. If you, however, get Google Glass, and bring it to school, only to wave hello at me, I will scream at you.</p>
<p>If we meet at the mall, and you're wearing Google Glass to record every single thing I do and say, I will scream at you.</p>
<p>Google Glass will take away the fleeting reality of the real world. The safest way to communicate right now is to talk, face to face in a forest or something, obviously without any technology on you.</p>
<p>Google Glass will change that. Then, there will be no relief from tracking and my screaming.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>This is difficult, but this is important. Those of you further along the privacy line will notice that some of the recommendations I make are a bit pseudo (eg. Gmail to Hushmail). This post is supposed to introduce those who know nothing about the reality of online privacy. If you want to walk the high-school student who lives for Facebook through Meshnet, you can. This is for the ones who care, but aren't willing to go as far as Meshnet.</p>
<p>Hopefully, when you make all of these enhancements, you'll also realize that your experience on the web is better. You're no longer limited in 140 characters spaces, web pages load up faster, and there are less evil people.</p>
<p>I've made only a couple in the past few months, and everything has changed. Especially #1, searching. Once you search for things organically, without the filter bubble, you realize how much information you've been missing out on.</p>
<p>You're living in a modern Brave New World, and it takes effort to fight against it. Join me and the others who are, though. We're the ones living in the real world. Are you?</p>
