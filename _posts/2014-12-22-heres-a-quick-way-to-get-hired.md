You're looking for a mentor, a job at a startup, or just work in general.

You're fresh off the grill. Seriously fresh. You just graduated high school or college and you're looking to gain skills by learning under other people (and hopefully getting paid to do so).

But if you have no skills already, how are you going to get a job that gives you both skills and experience?

It's this endless cycle that starts with harmless resume-blasting and ends with you taking absolutely any job you can for any kind of experience.

I'm here to tell you, fresh grad, that you do have skills and you can get a job at a company you admire.

First of all, let's just confirm something. You really do want this, right? You really want that job at that start-up or you want to work under that person you admire?

If you don't really want this, I want you to close this page right now. After you read the information I'm about to give you, there will be no excuses for you to not get your foot in the door somewhere promising.

I mean it. If you need to continue giving yourself excuses as to why your career is failing in order to continue functioning, stop reading this right now.

To those of you left on this page, hi, I'm Radhika Morabia. Six months ago, I was struggling with the same problem--"How do I get work if I have no skills to offer?"

Fast-forward to today, I'm running a consulting business, I've worked under a few people I admire, and this is just the beginning. In case you think the only way to get work these days is to learn advanced tech skills, I spent thousands of hours on the web in my life and I haven't acquired any at all.

What changed between now and then? I learned a few skills, yes, but I learned most of them on the job.

There's an untold truth in the world of business, and I'm going to tell it to you:

**People who are hiring you don't care about your degree, your sob story, or even your age. The only thing these people care about is if can solve their problem and if you can do so reliably.**

Let's dissect that.

## The Problem You're Solving

Does having an advanced degree solve anyone's problem? No.

Does having a long resume solve anyone's problem? No.

Does having a fancy website solve anyone's problem? No.

**The only thing that solves a problem is actually solving that problem.**

Let's step back a bit.

How do you find a problem to solve?

You know the industry you want to work in, right?

If you don't, just look at things you read about for fun and services you yourself are signed up for. Narrow that down into an industry that seems the most promising. (How do you know what's most promising? Gut feeling. If you need to, ask a few people you trust and admire if an industry is promising. Still lost? [Choose an industry YCombinator (one of the biggest sources of funding for startups around the globe) wants to see growth in.](https://www.ycombinator.com/rfs/)) Then, find thought leaders and companies you'd love to work under in that industry. Make a list of around 20 people. If you find more than that, great. If you find less than that, keep looking.

DO NOT STRESS OVER THIS. Choosing your first job or mentor isn't where you're going to stay for life. At any point, if it isn't working out and you're not finding the job valuable, you can always leave.

But, you'll never know if it will work out and be one of the most extraordinary experiences in your life unless you commit to choosing an industry. You will not stay in this industry forever. You can use what you learned in this industry in any other industry you want to go into in the future.

For more on this, read Cal Newport's brilliant book: [So Good They Can't Ignore You](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1455509124/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1455509124&linkCode=as2&tag=radhimorab0c-20&linkId=D24LG7BFOLNHOSLY). Strapped for time? [Read Derek Sivers' book notes.](http://sivers.org/book/SoGood)

Okay, now you know the industry. Beyond that, you even know examples of companies that you'd like to work for. You are now ahead of tons of people who are paralyzed by the sheer number of opportunities in front of them.

Since you're already interested in that industry or those companies, you probably know some little problems already. If not, dig around their website. Make note of every little thing that's wrong.

Yes, that's right. A little thing. Do not go after a big problem. We're looking for a little problem that you can solve.

Let's give some examples:

You want to work with a budding web startup. Could you do customer support for them?

You probably could. You're probably a fluent English speaker and you have a device that allows you to connect to the internet at least once every 24 hours. At these startups, it's usually the founders and programmers who are still handling support requests. You solve the problem of 1) serving their users in a more friendly way than a native programmer may be able to and 2) saving the founders and programmers time to work on what really matters, building their startup rather than maintaining it.

You want to work with a filmmaker who has a small web presence. Could you maintain their email newsletter for them?

You probably could. If you're not familiar with the tools out there yet, it'll take a week or two. The filmmaker will you a basic outline of what they want to send out to the fans on the newsletter, and you format it, make it pretty, and send it out once a month. This, again, solves two problems: 1) the newsletter's readers are happier with the better design and increased readability and 2) you save the filmmaker's time to focus on what they do best--filmmaking.

You want to work with an author who runs a blog for promotional purposes. Could you manually remove spam comments so they can focus on answering real humans?

You probably could. If you're not familiar with their current commenting platform, spend a few days figuring it out. Again, this saves the author time.

The problem you are trying to solve should ultimately help them either save time or make money. 

Notice in all the examples, you already possess the skills, or you have to spend a few hours reading that software's FAQ pages and documentation. That's it. No years of school, no thousands of dollars in tuition. It'll probably be free. If it isn't, it'll be the cost of the software you're maintaining for them or a few books on the subject.

Being a young web native, your best bet is to become an expert at maintaining some sort of software for the company at hand. There's so many startups creating tools for particular industries (yes, including other startups), and more and more companies are getting involved with using these products.

No, that doesn't mean you have to learn to program. Just learn how to get the job done and be prepared to handle troubleshooting with that software's support staff if it messes up.

There's your problem to solve. That's how to get your foot in the door.

## Being Reliable

You need experience to get experience, right?

Nope.

If you can show experience with personal projects and past work, great. If you can't, try and figure out the smallest possible project to showcase your experience.

For example, if you want to handle video editing for a company that's just starting to get into YouTube, create a one-minute video splicing together the best quotes from your favorite movie.

It doesn't have to go viral, you just have to prove you can edit videos.

If you seriously can't cite a personal project, that's fine. You can still get your foot in the door.

You're going to pitch that company and offer to do two weeks of work for free. Yep, that's right, free labor.

Before you protest, let me explain why.

* Your employer has no expectations because you're a young person working for free.
* There's no hassle of training, onboarding, or contracts for them.
* **This gets your foot in the door.**

You're sitting here, unemployed. These are two weeks that you would've spent blasting off resumes to people whose problems you aren't solving, anyway. It's just two weeks for the opportunity of a lifetime.

Also, you're not spending those two weeks working exclusively for one company. Fit in as many as you can. The transition from free to paid work won't always work out. Sometimes, they will let you go.

As you're pitching to solve their problem, make it very clear that you're only doing two weeks for free. If they think you did good work, then you're going to discuss going back to your usual rate. (This usual rate can be higher than normal rates for someone with your experience. Now that you're in the door, they need you and will do anything to keep you. Just don't push this too far.)

It's hard to say no when someone points out a problem of yours, the benefits it would give you to solve that problem, and then offers to do that for free.

Even so, you will get rejected. That's why you made a whole list of companies you'd like to work for.

After your two weeks of excellent work and great communication, they might not transition from free work to paid. That's fine. Just say thanks for the opportunity and move on. There are more companies out there. It was just two weeks.

But how do you do a perfect job in the first place?

Obviously, deliver on the problem you're solving. Do good work. Meet your deadlines.

Beyond that, though, there are a few crucial things:

* Keep your head down and don't act as if you've already made it in.
* If you make a mistake, tell your boss/client right away with honesty. Don't make excuses, just tell them.
* Do not be afraid to ask questions. Make sure you do so succintly and clearly.
* Deliver progress reports every few days. If you're scared you're overcommunicating, your boss/client will tell you. It's much better to overcommunicate than undercommunicate.
* Be friendly. Be casual, make small-talk, and especially if you landed a job at your dream company, do not fanboy.

Continue to show up, do the work, and remember to admit you're not perfect. If your job is getting easy and you're on good terms with your employer now, ask for more work. Keep taking on more responsibility to try and get as close to the action as possible. Learn everything you can and soak it all in.

Congratulations, you just got your first job.

Now that you have experience, you can easily go on and get more experience.
