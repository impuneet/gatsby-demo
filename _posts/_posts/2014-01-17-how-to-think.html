<p>The best thing I've ever done is learned how to think. It allows me to catch myself at times when my brain automatically goes to a conclusion. In argument, I always have a backdrop of reasons for when I decide on a stance.</p>
<p>I have more control over myself and the rest of the world, just by using my brain. It's basically the ultimate superpower.</p>
<h1>What is thinking?</h1>
<p>Thinking can mean a lot of different things to a lot of different people. So, what are we talking about when we talk about thinking?</p>
<p>We're talking about thinking:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clearly</strong>. You will always know your stance, if you have one.</li>
<li><strong>Critically</strong>. You will have support for your stance, if you have one.</li>
<li><strong>Logically</strong>. You will have support that abides to the laws of the world, if you have a stance.</li>
</ul>
<p>This will be used against yourself in decision-making, and if you wish, against others in argument or even simple communication. It will give you complete dominion over yourself and, if you wish, others.</p>
<p>David Foster Wallace also offers a definition on what thinking is: [emphasis by me]</p>
<blockquote><p>I have come gradually to understand that the liberal arts cliché about teaching you how to think is actually shorthand for a much deeper, more serious idea:<strong> learning how to think really means learning how to exercise some control over how and what you think</strong>. It means being conscious and aware enough to choose what you pay attention to and to choose how you construct meaning from experience. Because if you cannot exercise this kind of choice in adult life, you will be totally hosed. Think of the old cliché about quote the mind being an excellent servant but a terrible master. <cite>David Foster Wallace</cite></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>The #1 Principle of Thinking:</h1>
<p><strong>Be willing to change your mind in light of new and logical information.</strong></p>
<p>I'm a vegetarian, and I stand by that firmly. If sometime in the future, someone convinces me that my ethical, health, and economic reasons for being  a vegetarian are incorrect, and that adopting another diet is seriously more practical, I have to change my mind.</p>
<p>So far, the only mildly convincing evidence that vegetarianism doesn't work is health-related, but even then, different diets work for different people, so the argument is invalid.</p>
<p>But, if ever in the future, there are compelling arguments that make sense at a rational level, I have to be willing to change my mind, even though I've been holding this belief about vegetarianism since birth.</p>
<h1>Common Cognitive Biases</h1>
<p>You have an open mind now, right? You're enthusiastic and willing about me telling me you're wrong about nearly everything? You're willing to hear me tell you that you have biases that give you a very limited worldview? Good.</p>
<p>You hold a lot of biases that give you a very limited worldview. Don't worry, I have a lot, too. If we work on them together, the world will suddenly get wider and wider, until you realize that anything is possible and that you actually know very little about it all.</p>
<p>We're going to cover a few sets of biases that you need to digest and work on very slowly. I'm going to present what they are and how you can combat them, until you're a master who catches yourself every time.</p>
<h2>Confirmation Bias</h2>
<p><strong>WHAT IS IT?</strong>:Confirmation Bias is when we only see things that confirm our previous beliefs. For example, when you're watching a Presidential Debate, you tend to hear that everything (or mostly everything) you agree with is from the presidential candidate you've already chosen.</p>
<p>You rarely think that both sides make multitudes of good points. There's the good side and the evil side, and you must never side with the evil side.</p>
<p>Warren Buffett describes it perfectly:</p>
<blockquote><p>What the human being is best at doing is interpreting all new information so that their prior conclusions remain intact. <cite>Warren Buffett</cite></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>WHY DOES IT MATTER?: </strong>Your decisions will be skewed by the beliefs you already have. How old could those beliefs be? You could still be believing that DNA strands don't exist, even though science proved it to be so. Imagine how much progress would hinder if everyone gave in to confirmation bias. Your personal progress is being hindered by this.</p>
<p><strong>SOLUTION:</strong> <a title="How I Read" href="http://www.rmorabia.com/read/">Get a book</a> or an article that presents arguments that are against your own. Look at the support the author gives, and if needed, get other similar books that give even more support. Write out every argument and reasoning for the argument, and stack them against your own beliefs and reasoning behind them. Are you still sure that you're 100% right?</p>
<h2>Bandwagon Effect</h2>
<p><strong>WHAT IS IT?: </strong>The Bandwagon Effect is when you do something because everyone else is doing it, whether that's in fashion taste, music, movies, or even a big decision like going to college and majoring in STEM.</p>
<p><strong>WHY DOES IT MATTER?: </strong>People use this all the time to try and sway you. Take a look at infomercials, "2 million happy customers!" and "100,000 people have already tried [product], why haven't you?" More than that, your peers use it, the media uses it, and authority figures use it. <strong>They're all trying to make you mediocre.</strong></p>
<p><strong>SOLUTION:</strong> Don't give in to peer pressure! Easier said than done, I know. If you're making a certain decision, ask yourself why. If one of your reasons, however subtle and however much you try to mask it, is "because everyone else is doing it," then you need to rethink your decision.</p>
<h2>Attentional Bias</h2>
<p><strong>WHAT IS IT?:</strong> When we're trying to make a decision, we tend to overlook a ton of possibilities. Have you ever had a friend come to you with a seemingly limited problem, where you could only choose this or that? But you saw a third possibility that she didn't think about on her own, and everything was fixed. You fall prey to this, too.</p>
<p><strong>WHY DOES IT MATTER?:</strong> You could be severely limiting yourself. When you're traveling, you could be confining yourself to only specific places, not taking into account every possibility. When you're dissatisfied with your job, you can only think of "Quit this job and be broke," or "Stay with this job and be unhappy." This bias drastically affects your life and your future.</p>
<p><strong>SOLUTION:</strong> When you're making a decision, list out the possibilities. Ask yourself "What if?" questions, and resist the itch that says "That's impossible." That's the itch that limits you to only these two possibilities, which may or may not be the best ones. Really consider every possibility.</p>
<h2>Hyperbolic Discounting</h2>
<p><strong>WHAT IS IT?:</strong> Heard of YOLO or Carpe Diem used to mask bad decisions? Or have you ever eaten a cake when you were on a diet because it'll feel good now? Maybe you've heard of the terms "instant gratification" and "delayed gratification." Hyperbolic discounting is when you discount delayed gratification because all you want in the world is some instant gratification, and you want it right now.</p>
<p><strong>WHY DOES IT MATTER?:</strong> Imagine if everything you ever did was in pursuit of instant gratification. You'd be dead years ago. However, if you work towards something with delayed gratification more often, the payoffs would be exponentially greater. This can apply to every priority in your life--health, career, relationships, etc..</p>
<p><strong>SOLUTION:</strong> Have a clear image of what you're going to receive when you finish your delayed gratification goal. Whenever you want to give up or do something that gives you instant gratification, take a moment and remind yourself of that image. Now, get back to work.</p>
<h2>Planning Fallacy</h2>
<p><strong>WHAT IS IT?: </strong>Have you ever started a project and estimated it would only take a week, but next thing you know, it's been three? That's the planning fallacy, our tendency to underestimate how long a task or project will take.</p>
<p><strong>WHY DOES IT MATTER?: </strong>If you tell your boss an underestimation of time it takes to complete a task, it could cause you to lose your job, or at least put you in the negative eye. With companies, it's even worse, since the public thinks you're incompetent. Your reputation is at stake here, along with your own stress levels.</p>
<p><strong>SOLUTION:</strong> If you've done a similar task before, recall how long it took, and give yourself the same amount of time. If you don't know how long it took, start tracking your time, so you can look back at it and avoid the planning fallacy.</p>
<h2>Hindsight Bias</h2>
<p><strong>WHAT IS IT?:</strong> Think of an extremely negative or positive event in your life. Why did it happen? In hindsight, you can see everything that ever led up to that event. But is it accurate, or are you attributing things that are irrelevant? Did you really know it all along?</p>
<p><strong>WHY DOES IT MATTER?:</strong> Most of these events are out of your control, yet you attribute them to your own or others' behavior. This could cause you blame someone or yourself, adding extra and unnecessary stress. Honestly, these events could've happened by sheer luck, coincidence, or other factors way outside of your locus of control.</p>
<p><strong>SOLUTION:</strong> Stop asking yourself "Why?" when something of importance happens. Try to accept it as it is, and don't make up a story explaining it. Admit that you don't really know.</p>
<h2>Illusion of Control</h2>
<p><strong>WHAT IS IT?:</strong> You think that you can sway your boss to stop the project, or that you can fix your relationship when it isn't really about you. Everything is in your control, and the world revolves around you, right?</p>
<p><strong>WHY DOES IT MATTER?:</strong> The simple truth is, very little is in your control. You can begin to take on responsibilities that you really have no business taking on, and get discouraged and angry when things don't go your way. If it's not in your control, you're wasting your efforts.</p>
<p><strong>SOLUTION: </strong>Remember that you really only have control over yourself. As much as you can influence your surroundings, you will never be able to control it. Get used to how mortal you are.</p>
<h2>Gambler's Fallacy</h2>
<p><strong>WHAT IS IT?:</strong> Think about roulette. After the ball chooses one number, there's a higher probability of it going on your number, because now that first number is cancelled out, right? Wrong. Probability stays the same, no matter the past results.</p>
<p><strong>WHY DOES IT MATTER?:</strong> If you're a gambler, you had better understand this fallacy, or you'll get broke really quickly. This fallacy also plays an important role in our personal lives, though. "Since it rained today, it's less likely to rain tomorrow," when in reality--rain isn't determined by how often it falls, but by the precipitation cycle.</p>
<p><strong>SOLUTION:</strong> Remember how things are actually determined. Just because a situation occurs, doesn't mean the probability of that situation decreases. In the probability example with the bag of multi-colored marbles, remember that after choosing your marble, you put it right back in. The probability of getting that specific color remains the same.</p>
<h2>Special Snowflake Bias</h2>
<p>(Yes, I made this title up myself.)</p>
<p><strong>WHAT IS IT?: </strong>When you're trying to make a decision, you have your own emotional biases. Oftentimes, to combat this, we go to a trusted friend and present the evidence in question. They respond without your own emotional baggage, and you realize that they're right.</p>
<p><strong>WHY DOES IT MATTER?: </strong>You should be able to combat this yourself. If a friend isn't available or you're making a confidential decision, you should be able to go through the rational, unemotional decision-making process on your own.</p>
<p><strong>SOLUTION: </strong>It's simple. Take a step back from your situation. Act like the unbiased friend. Present the information to yourself, and disregard all the emotional baggage. It's difficult, but it's still simple. Look at the decision like you're not you.</p>
<h1>Further Reading:</h1>
<p>What I give you above isn't a conclusive list of biases. There are tons more resources about rationality and cognitive biases that can help you get better at dominating your brain. Here are my favorites:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://youarenotsosmart.com">You Are Not So Smart</a></strong> - David McRaney has a blog, a book series, and a podcast. Get it all. It's a very approachable introduction to all of the psychology we talk about here.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://hpmor.com">Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality</a></strong> - This is a fanfiction of Harry Potter where Petunia married a biochemistry professor. Harry's brought up with science and science fiction, and looks at the new wizarding world around him with that background. It makes for a great alternate reality. I recommend reading a chapter and then searching for the title for more information on the science that the specific chapter discusses.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Sequences">LessWrong Sequences</a></strong> - LessWrong is a community of aspiring rationalists. The main page is full of complicated stuff, but by going through all of the sequences, you should have a ton of knowledge that can help you get into the community.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a></strong> - Just look up the name of the bias or even take a look at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases">List of Cognitive Biases</a> to learn more.</li>
<li><strong>Books/Articles You Disagree With</strong> - Always challenge your ideas. Take note of the arguments presented in the writing and write out arguments that debunk the claims. Wait a day, calm down, and look back at your arguments. How compelling are they? Do you need to change your mind about something?</li>
</ul>
<p>All of this should give you enough to get you started and open yourself up to a whole new world where you're actually using your brain. Digest it slowly and take your time. You aren't supposed to be transformed over night. You have to train your brain to accept these new ideas and to catch yourself when you're employing these biases. It will take time.</p>
