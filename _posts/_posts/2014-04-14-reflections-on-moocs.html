<p>In late 2013, I took on some online courses as an experiment. <a title="Lessons Learned from 9 Months in Isolation" href="http://www.rmorabia.com/self-development/">I was in public online school before</a>, but MOOCs are much different than that closed, dumbed-down system I was in</p>
<p>I had certain biases towards the system (I already hated online learning programs like KhanAcademy and <a href="http://rmorabia.com/code">Codecademy</a>), but I had never actually taken these courses, so I asked around. People seemed to genuinely like these MOOCs, so I got involved in Coursera, Udacity, and Udemy. I felt that edX was too similar to Coursera for me to try out, maybe I was wrong. Maybe that was the only good platform and I missed it.</p>
<p>In the end, I completed zero courses. I chose some that had interesting, intellectual masturbation-type premises, and I chose others with technical rigor. I tried quite hard. I got through at least half of most of them, but I couldn't complete any of them. I wasn't impressed.</p>
<h2>What Worked</h2>
<p>Even though I did not like any of these platforms, there's still some potential hidden deep in these first tests.</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Coursera had a very clean interface.</strong> As a platform itself, it worked well. There was accessibility, flexibility, adaptability for a wide range of courses, and the forums system was never dead, like most online courses.</li>
<li><strong>There is credibility.</strong> The professors at each Coursera, Udacity, and Udemy seemed to be experts. None of them were just no-names who could throw something up like Wikiversity.</li>
<li><strong>They're popular.</strong> Although each of these courses has an absurdly low graduation rate, there are devoted fans. <a href="http://theinstitute.ieee.org/ieee-roundup/opinions/ieee-roundup/low-completion-rates-for-moocs">There's a devoted following of people who already have an adult education.</a> I guess they have fun with their intellectual masturbation.</li>
<li><strong>They're <em>something</em>.</strong> A chance for a free education is still a chance for a free education. They're experiments, and the hype around them is a positive rather than a negative at this point. The results of these experiments pave the road for positive change, to finally turn online education into something real. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/11/us/after-setbacks-online-courses-are-rethought.html?action=click&amp;module=Search&amp;region=searchResults&amp;mabReward=csesort%3Aw&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fquery.nytimes.com%2Fsearch%2Fsitesearch%2F%23%2FUdacity%2F">I like what Udacity's doing in 2014</a>, and that's the result of a few failed experiments.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h2>What Didn't Work</h2>
<ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Why are we trying to recreate a college lecture? </strong>Online education is the chance to do something different. At this stage in MOOCs, we're trying to adapt the online world to education. We can go so much farther if we do the exact opposite. I've learned 99% of what I know from the internet. What if we adopted that kind of model to a more accessible form, instead of being scattered and not being user-friendly? That would be a true online education platform. (<a href="http://rmorabia.com/code">Some courses which attempt to teach students to code are doing this well.</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Why do we have to do video?</strong> There are so many problems with trying to use video as the main form of learning. <a href="http://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2012/11/13/why-lectures/">Scott Young, who's blog primarily revolves around alternative education and learning, puts forth a great argument against the video fad.</a> To add to that, video's expensive and hasn't been successfully made into an open, accessible platform like text. On the other end, for the user, video is absolutely passive. It also forces a speed (no, YouTube's speed-control option doesn't help), and isn't compatible with students who want to learn at their own pace, which is the most interesting possibility online.</li>
<li><strong>The community isn't great. </strong>I really tried participating in the forums and stuff, but there's a different issue for each of the three platforms. Coursera is too bloated. No one's really contributing valuable conversation, other than the local meetup talk. Udacity had stuff very sporadically. Since it's self-paced, there are just a bunch of old questions. (This is an issue with KhanAcademy and Codecademy, as well.) Udemy had barely any participation. I did not feel like I could get value out of any of them.</li>
<li><strong>These courses are dumbed down. </strong>This was my biggest issue with MOOCs. Udemy and Udacity (at least the intro courses here, I couldn't get further) were in 2-5 minute segments, which were too short to feel like a real commitment. I understand that their goal was to push participation by making it as easy as possible to come back day after day, but I never get into the flow from a 5-minute video. Coursera constantly pushed at me "If you want more information, read [professor's book.]" Why am I taking this course if it's just a summary of the book? Each video was similar to some summary I could find on YouTube, or the entire week's videos put together could be a PBS documentary. I was frustrated with these intellectual masturbation courses, so I signed up for a technical, university-equivalent class. I found complaints in the forums about how this was a cut down version of the real class, and the responses from the staff were that the medium didn't allow the detail that a university classroom would allow. I dropped that class immediately.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>...</p>
<p>I'm not that impressed. I don't like TED Talks (unless I already like the speaker), I don't think Sal Khan is a good math teacher, I don't think MOOCs have anything going for them other than intellectual masturbation. I think the "interactive learning" right now is absolutely horrid, so I'm going to keep on <a href="http://rmorabia.com/read">reading books to learn</a>.</p>
<p>When there's a better option, I will be open and willing to try it out. I am entitled to these opinions because I pushed aside my biases and tried it out.</p>
