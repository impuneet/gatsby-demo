<p>This had a really interesting concept. What would you do if you had forever without any consequences?</p>

<p>The answer to that seemed very natural. First, have fun sinning. But after a while, sinning does get very boring. We don't get to actually see how far these sins went (torture, murder, etc., all we got was creepy pick-up) because in the end, it was rated PG.</p>

<p>Then, try to make do everything you can before your clock resets again. This was kind of creepy in this movie, though. Movies with mild time travel like this are always a little creepy. This was obviously unsuccessful, because although we all like to say "Live every day like it's your last," that's a very dull way to live.</p>

<p>Next, the suicide attempts. There were so many. I wonder how many years this lasted.</p>

<p>Finally, Phil settled on art. He learned art, created art, and fell in love with all kinds of art. That was amazing to me, and something that so many movies miss. Also, this movie took place over an estimated 40 years, so he fell in love with Rita along the way. I wonder how many times he actually got her to like him, or if it was only the last day. I think it was a lot more than once, because on the last day, she's very obviously interested, and Phil mildly blows her off. But it's the fact that he wasn't alone that night that allowed him to finally break out of the loop, right?</p>

<p>The creators share so little about what brought him into the loop and what finally brought him out. It might have been Phil the Groundhog, because you know, he's a god, and Phil the weatherman insulted him. It also could have just been a total accident when he fell into the loop and out. Maybe this happens to 100 people globally every century.</p>

<p>Beyond the concept, though, I got a little bored. The problem was just that it wasn't engaging enough. Because of the nature of the story, it got a bit repetitive. I think it might have been suited for another medium, but I can't think of a medium where repeating the same day over and over again would ever be engaging. They worked with what they had, and got huge results. It was commercially successful, followed by quite a few awards, and finally, it's culturally significant. How much more can you want from a film?</p>
