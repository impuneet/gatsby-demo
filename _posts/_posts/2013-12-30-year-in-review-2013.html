<p>Welcome to 2014. For me, it feels like my year started in June. Being on a semester system in school, it feels like January-May was a totally different year.</p>
<p>It's been a bit exciting, if not grueling. I've grown a lot, but at the same time, I've fallen back towards resistance and am still struggling with Step 1 of <a href="http://www.rmorabia.com/control/">How To Take Control of Your Life</a>. When I let the biggest hindrance go, I start to look for something to fill the time with, and sadly, I fell back into it.</p>
<p>I was wrong about a ton of stuff this year, but I can also say I was also really right about a lot, too. I've probably made a ton of mistakes that are going to affect me in the long run, but the time to <a title="When To Change Your Life" href="http://www.rmorabia.com/change/">change my life</a> is coming up one week into the New Year, so we'll see how it goes.</p>
<p>I think I'm struggling the most with a sense of direction. I know what I want to do in the long run, but right now, no options seem viable for my unique situation. Yes, maybe I'm a teenager convinced that I'm a special snowflake, but it's still difficult in the present. One of the best skills you can have is to look at your present hardship as how you do when you look at your hardship in hindsight.</p>
<p>All I can attest to doing this year is trying.</p>
<h1>Lessons Learned in 2013</h1>
<p>I learned a lot in 2013, but but the following five lessons were the most apparent. You may notice that I already learned some of these in my <a title="Lessons Learned from 9 Months in Isolation" href="http://www.rmorabia.com/self-development/">9 months of isolation</a> (all in 2012), but there's only so much you can take to heart every year. These were my 5.</p>
<p>The biggest way I learned this year was through repeated exposure. (You can see some of it by looking at my <a href="http://www.rmorabia.com/category/quotes/">quotes</a> and by looking at my <a href="http://delicious.com/rmorabia">Delicious account</a>. I hope to have more visible patterns in the following year.)</p>
<h2>Lesson #1: Everything is a choice.</h2>
<p>You call your friend up, "Hey, let's go to the movies." He responds: "I can't, man. I  <em>have to</em> finish this paper." <em></em></p>
<p>Truth is, he doesn't have to finish that paper.</p>
<p>You don't have to go to school, you don't have to get a job, you don't have to be on Facebook, you don't have to have a phone, and you don't have to eat meat at every meal. You can seriously do whatever you want.</p>
<p>I can feel you itching at this prospect. I know how you feel. But think about it--what's the #1 thing you feel forced into? Now think of a life without it.</p>
<p>Without a structured school system, my stress, anxiety, and depression would dramatically decrease, giving me way more time to actually learn, or even do activities that would get me into college (APs, SATs). More importantly, I would get time to recover from my health issues.</p>
<p>Itch. Without school, without a degree, no one will hire you. Who says I need a job? There's freelancing.</p>
<p>Itch. You're useless without a degree. You have no marketable skills. Then get a marketable skill, you're saving years of time without a degree.</p>
<p>Itch. What if you can't? Aha. We've reached our limit. There is nothing you can't do. Remember, everything is a choice.</p>
<p>I'm not saying I am dropping out of school, but if the need arises, will I be okay? Probably. I know I'm smart enough. I may not be as affluent as if I would be if I went to school and then college, but I know I would be okay. That's the most important thing.</p>
<p>This is actually a Stoic exercise I've heard about vaguely. The stoics would sometimes put themselves in the situation of beggars: sleeping on the floor, eating little,and  wearing rags, to appreciate and understand their own situation of wealth more.</p>
<p>People may think it's idiotic, but when you're stuck inside your own worldview, what will happen when it crumbles?</p>
<h2>Lesson #2: Define your success.</h2>
<p>When I started this blog, my about page said that I was focusing on "Setting myself up for success."</p>
<p>What is success?</p>
<p>Well, some kind of applied quantitative field, maybe... As long as I'm economically okay, I think that's successful.<em> I don't want to limit myself.</em></p>
<p>The more I looked around, the more important defining your success came to be. If you're not, you're just flailing around randomly.</p>
<p>Just think about it. Opening yourself up to everything means I should be learning molecular biology (and I heavily dislike biology) at the same time as advanced statistics. When deep down inside, I much prefer statistics.</p>
<p>Read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1455509124/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1455509124&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=radhimorab0c-20">So Good They Can't Ignore You by Cal Newport</a> and then just pick something to progress towards. Make sure it's very specific, and it adheres to your values. Even if you change your mind, the focused skills you picked up while moving towards towards your choice will carry over to the new choice.</p>
<p>It's a much better alternative than going two steps in one direction, seven steps in another, and then backtracking because you have no idea where you are.</p>
<h2>Lesson #3: Constantly challenge your ideas.</h2>
<p><a title="How I Read" href="http://www.rmorabia.com/read/">And the easiest way to do so is through books.</a></p>
<p>Think about something your mom told you as a kid. For me, we had these high stools to eat dinner with, so it was so much fun to shake my legs. My mom would always say, "Radhika, when you shake your legs, you hurt my stomach," as if I was in the womb and kicking.</p>
<p>Obviously, that's ludicrous, looking back at it. But how would I know, if I never challenged my own ideas by kicking my legs when she was out of the room?</p>
<p>It's the same with any long-held belief. Society will criticize you for changing your mind (and when you start doing this, it will be quite often), but who cares? You're a better person, now. All they do is read the same 10 books for their whole life and think they know everything, why should their opinion be of any value to you?</p>
<p>Meanwhile, you can learn from the greatest historical and fictional figures. Take what's applicable to you, and what's good for you, then toss out their faults.</p>
<p>The best way to challenge your ideas is to talk to tons of different people, but if you  live in some American suburb like me, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/mn/landing/283155/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;tag=radhimorab0c-20">Amazon</a> has a ton of conversations waiting to happen.</p>
<h2>Lesson #4: Aiming for efficiency is useless.</h2>
<p>I'm about to do some work. Let me put on a podcast...</p>
<p>I'm merely listening to music. Let me go and read something...</p>
<p>I'm watching a show? Let me check my messages...</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>This is such a difficult lesson to learn, because our computers multi-task so well. Naturally, you want to take advantage of all the technology available to you, but even a computer is more productive while single-tasking. (Try downloading multiple files at a time, and then again one at a time. Which is faster?)</p>
<p>But you can feel it, while you're multi-tasking, the pure frustration of a notification pop-up or buzz. You can feel it when you have to rewind the podcast because you have no clue what they just said. You can feel it when you've read the same paragraph for 8 times.</p>
<p>There has to be a better way, and that better way is single-tasking. This includes listening to music music. This especially includes shutting your phone off and exiting the email tab.</p>
<p>It takes 1.5x as long to multi-task on a task. It takes .7x as long to single-task and <em>focus</em>.</p>
<p>Focus is the key to everything.</p>
<h2>Lesson #5: Document everything.</h2>
<p>Humans are horrific at remembering what made them happy, and what made them sad. We have no clue when our peak hours of energy are and we have no clue how about how useless we feel when we eat sugar daily.</p>
<p>Try it for a month. Document <em>everything. </em></p>
<ul>
<li>Track where your time goes.</li>
<li>Track your energy level.</li>
<li>Track your ideas.</li>
<li>Track your distractions.</li>
<li>Track how adding something to your day made you feel.</li>
<li>Track how subtracting something from your day made you feel.</li>
<li>Track when you feel really happy.</li>
<li>Track when you feel really sad.</li>
</ul>
<p>After tracking everything, you'll be able to see the patterns in your life. Something unexpected will either make you feel really bad or really good. Move towards the good and subtract the bad as much as you can.</p>
<h1>Best of 2013</h1>
<p>I consumed quite a bit in 2013. A lot of it was good, but a good portion was really bad. However, if I had to choose just one thing I could consume from each category, the following would be it.</p>
<h2>Best Book of 2013: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0679723161/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0679723161&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=radhimorab0c-20">Lolita by Vladimir Nabokov</a></h2>
<p>It's odd to choose this, considering that I haven't finished it. I started in January, and have continued to pick it up sporadically, now reaching around page 200 out of 300.</p>
<p>Even though I haven't finished, Nabokov is excellent. I was a fan before I even started reading Lolita. The sheer fact that I've been unable to finish it because it's just such a haunting novel adds to Nabokov's genius.</p>
<p>I can't say I've learned as many lessons than from the non-fiction I've been reading or something like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0486278077/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0486278077&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=radhimorab0c-20">The Picture of Dorian Gray</a>, but it's amazing, nonetheless.</p>
<h2>Best Article of 2013: <a href="http://www.ryanholiday.net/advice-to-a-young-man-hoping-to-go-somewhere-or-get-something-from-someone-successful/">Advice to a Young Man Hoping to Go Somewhere (Or Get Something From Someone Successful) by Ryan Holiday</a></h2>
<p>Ryan Holiday is someone I discovered 9 months ago, and who has changed my life dramatically. I've read a ton of his stuff (although none of his books, I'm more interested in his philosophy than marketing. He does have a book on Stoicism coming out called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591846358/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1591846358&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=radhimorab0c-20">The Obstacle is the Way</a>, however. I'm definitely buying that.), but I had to choose one article as the best of 2013.</p>
<p>I looked back at my <a href="http://rmorabia.tumblr.com/">ol</a><span style="line-height: 1.6;"><a href="http://rmorabia.tumblr.com/">d archive of information</a>, and noticed that I had quoted this one the most. Therefore, it becomes the best of 2013. </span><span style="line-height: 1.6;"><br />
</span></p>
<p>I heavily identify with 19 year old Ryan Holiday, and the fact that he has a whole compendium of advice (and a whole wealth of other information in the comments. I probably only read comments on Ryan Holiday's website) is fantastic.</p>
<p>If you're close to joining the working world, or are new to the working world, I highly recommend reading it.</p>
<h2>Best Movie of 2013: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00F1RTVWA/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00F1RTVWA&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=radhimorab0c-20">Lootera</a></h2>
<p>Yes, my favorite movie of 2013 is a Romantic Drama. Judge me.</p>
<p>It was incredibly well-made and I found absolutely no flaws, which is rare for a film. I've seen it twice, but both times I sobbed (the first being in a theatre).</p>
<p>If you haven't seen it, you should. It's not a gushy chick film, even though it falls into that category. I despise gushy chick films (think Nicholas Sparks), but I really like emotions.</p>
<p>Lootera masters emotions and characters. It's also a period film (India right after independence), and the movie reflects the times well.</p>
<h2>Best Video Game of 2013: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000035Y63/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000035Y63&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=radhimorab0c-20">Earthbound</a></h2>
<p>Have you ever started up a game and felt pure happiness flood into you? That happened to me with Earthbound, and it happened every time I started up Earthbound.</p>
<p>The humor is fantastic, the gameplay is fun, the music is wondrous, the story is only a bit cliche, and the overall game is just pure fun.</p>
<p>I never felt frustrated while playing it, but at the same time, I never got bored. It's an SNES RPG classic, and I highly recommend picking it up.</p>
<p>If you don't have an SNES or can't afford a cartridge, play it through an emulator on your computer. (Email me at <a href="mailto:hi@rmorabia.com">hi@rmorabia.com</a> if you need help with that.)</p>
<h2>Best Music of 2013: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Frank-Turner/e/B001LHXD5K/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;qid=1388433024&amp;sr=8-2-acs&amp;tag=radhimorab0c-20">Frank Turner</a></h2>
<p>There was so much good music in 2013. Spotify really helped with that. The Discover tool is amazing. But Frank Turner was the best, and Spotify failed to make me discover him.</p>
<p>I went to NPR's music site one day, and scrolled to the bottom to find a <a href="http://www.npr.org/event/music/198794929/frank-turner-tiny-desk-concert">Tiny Desk Concert of Frank Turner</a> as the first video. I'd never seen a Tiny Desk Concert before and only sometimes listened to the 24/7 radio channels that NPR had, but I played the video. It opened with Recovery and I was immediately hooked. I downloaded the whole album and eventually wanted more.</p>
<p>By the end of the year, I got every single album, EP, and compilation album that Frank Turner had released. I'd seen every full concert available on YouTube (single performances recorded through iPhone are always dull), but sadly missed his US tour this year. I probably know over half of all his lyrics. I looked into getting merch, but there wasn't much good stuff except the tour shirt (which I didn't go to!).</p>
<p>I'm convinced that Frank Turner knows the meaning of life, and if I listen to him enough, I'll learn it, too.</p>
<p>If you look into him, I suggest starting with the latest album, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CBULSBW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00CBULSBW&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=radhimorab0c-20"><em>Tape Deck Heart</em></a>, and if you like it, move backwards from there.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>That's it, that's 2013. It's gone, now. Try not to look back at all the time you wasted or how much you could've accomplished this year. Notice the positives and try to make 2014 better.</p>
<p>"Should have"s are the most useless baggage to hold. Instead, say "I will" in 2014.</p>
