I was diagonosed with heavy [astigmatism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astigmatism) a few weeks ago and had to get glasses. Here's my experience going from practically never using glasses to having to wear lasses for extended periods of time every day.

## Day 1: July 7th, 2014

- disorienting
- red/blue colors show up at the edges of my peripheral vision
- flat books shaped like a trapezoid
- table looks slanted - like [Relativity by M.C. Escher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_%28M._C._Escher%29)
	- all the stuff on my desk should be sliding off of the "lowest point" of the table
	- but it all abides by normal gravity and physics, as if it wasn't insanely slanted
- real-life tripping
- reading is still difficult, it's just a new problem
