<p>Contrary to what you may have heard about this book, it's not a more readable summary of the Encyclopedia. It's riddled with editing errors (eg. "That's an strange concept.") and pop culture references that became outdated long before the book even hit the shelves.</p>

<p>Although there is some interesting trivia, most of the book revolves around an incompetent narcissist who is unable to tell the difference between knowledge and wisdom, or intelligence and one who is smart. Jacobs believes voracious readers should be excellent at crossword puzzles, and puzzlers should be competent enough to win "Who Wants To Be a Millionaire?" Most of the book is spent trying to prove this outrageous claim correct. And don't forget, Mensans should be millionaires.</p>

<p>If none of your friends have any remotely interesting stories and you very much like 2002's pop culture, this book is for you.</p>

<p>Want to read a summary of the Encyclopedia? Try...the Encyclopedia! It's a summary of all human knowledge for a reason.</p>

<p>(Pair this with <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/03/books/review/03QUEENAN.html?_r=0">Joe Queenan's review in The New York Times</a>. He says everything I wish to say with much more eloquence.)</p>
