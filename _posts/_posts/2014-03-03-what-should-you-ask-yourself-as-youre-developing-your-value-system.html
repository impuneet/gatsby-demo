<p>Your value system will direct you through your whole life. It's important to develop it as a guiding principle for all of your decisions. To help you think about what values you have, here are some questions to ask yourself.</p>
<p>Remember, be very specific. Go into detail. Feel free to mull over a question for a few days before moving on. Also, <a href="http://rmorabia.com/2k13">document everything</a>. Write your answers down for reference.</p>
<p>What does happiness look like to you?</p>
<p>What does <a href="http://www.rmorabia.com/tag/success/">success</a> look like to you?</p>
<p>Within your inner circle (maybe a little beyond your inner circle), who do you admire?</p>
<p>What traits overlap in these people?</p>
<p>Within your group of idols (some of these could be in your inner circle), what traits overlap in these people?</p>
<p>Who is the most successful person in history? (If you can't list any, go out and look up some history.)</p>
<p>What traits brought them their success?</p>
<p>What did you want to be as a little kid?</p>
<p>Without any restrictions except your own mortality, what would you like to look back on when you're 95 years old?</p>
<p>What is <a href="http://rmorabia.com/pseudo">pseudo</a> to you?</p>
<p>What are your favorite books? (If you can't list any, go out and read some books.)</p>
<p>What lessons overlap within these books?</p>
<p>What are your favorite movies?</p>
<p>What lessons overlap within these movies?</p>
<p>What are your favorite video games?</p>
<p>What lessons overlap within these video games?</p>
<p>What are your favorite [any other media here]?</p>
<p>What lessons overlap within these [media]?</p>
<p>What is style to you?</p>
<p>What are your favorite <a href="http://www.rmorabia.com/category/quotes/">quotes</a>? Save these in a commonplace book.</p>
<p>If you could choose one phrase to guide you in the rest of your life, what would it be? Print that out and put it near your working space.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>After answering all of these questions and writing down the answers in a safe place, set up a schedule to look back and review these answers. This could be part of your yearly review, or if you feel that you're in a period of great change, it could be monthly.</p>
