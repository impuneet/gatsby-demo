<p>I was going to develop a series called "<a href="http://www.rmorabia.com/consumption-1/">What I've Been Consuming</a>," last year. The problem is, I don't consume that much anymore. I read one book a week, watch one movie a week, don't play video games regularly anymore, barely discover any new music, and I don't surf the net at all.</p>
<p>I expect to do a yearly review of the books I read at the end of 2014, but I don't consume enough to justify a monthly series on the topic.</p>
<p>I'm a firm believer in consumption--don't get me wrong. I think you need it to <a title="How to Be Original" href="http://www.rmorabia.com/original/">be original</a>, but I'm valuing more consumption away from the screen these days.</p>
<p>What I do online, though, I'm a die-hard fan for. Everything I'm subscribed to has changed my life at least once. The list always changing, because I'm always experimenting with new blogs and people to follow online, but as of right now--May 14th, 2014, here's what I'm subscribed to:</p>
<h2>Blogs:</h2>
<p>I keep out a few things I'm subscribed to, either because the posts are very infrequent or I skip a lot of the received content. I could've also forgotten about a few.</p>

<h2>Podcasts:</h2>
<p>I have a very love-hate relationship with podcasts. There are so many I want to get into (history podcasts in particular), but I just can't bring myself to do it. I have a very specific taste, and it seems to be very interview-based.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://wtfpod.com">WTF with Marc Maron</a></strong> - I just discovered this podcast recently, and I am obsessed. I love Marc Maron because he's not afraid to talk about the dark side of life. Each episode is funny, dark, and inspirational at the same time.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://lewishowes.com/category/podcast/">The School of Greatness</a></strong> - This is the only sort of self-development podcast I can stand. There's a huge cast of people that Lewis interviews, from athletes to entrepreneurs to celebrities, and he knows exactly what to ask them.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.mountainshores.net/">Mountain Shores</a></strong> - This is a monthly (or so) chat between <a href="http://www.friendlyanarchist.com/">Fabian Kruse</a>, <a href="http://www.clearmindedcreative.com/">Milo McLaughlin</a>, and (sometimes) <a href="http://www.sustainablycreative.com/">Michael Nobbs</a> about making it with a creative life.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007qmxj">Love Bollywood</a> </strong>- It's the only Bollywood podcast I know of. Interviews with the people I adore are always fun to listen to.</li>
</ul>
