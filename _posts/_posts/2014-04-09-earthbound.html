<p>Earthbound is a wacky game from 1995 that somehow became my favorite game ever. It's part of the Mother series in Japan, but Earthbound, or Mother 2, became the only game to be officially released in the US. There are fan-made English versions that are quite good, and if you want more information about all of that, check out <a href="http://starmen.net">Starmen.net</a>.</p>
<p>Earthbound is a a JRPG set in modern America, or as they call it, Eagleland. This is very unconventional for the times, since all JRPGs were set in some fantasy universe with dragons and swords. For something very typical around the same time, check out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_VI">Final Fantasy VI</a>.</p>
<p>Basically, these are Japanese people making a game about America. Hilarity ensues.</p>
<p>The setting is gorgeous. It's not fantastic dirt roads and quaint Middle Ages shops, but areas that look like real cities and towns. Take a look at this map of Fourside:</p>
<p><img src="http://walkthrough.starmen.net/earthbound/image/maps/fourside.png" width="800"></p>
<p>You get to fight crazy enemies like Abstract Art, Mad Taxis, a Scalding Coffee Cup, and an Unassuming Local Guy.</p>
<p>The humor is amazing. Here are some sample quotes:</p>
<blockquote><p>I wonder if the monster guarding Giant Step is stronger then my wife.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Prepare to face my Super-Ultra-Mambo-Tango-Foxtrot martial arts!</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>New Age Retro Hippie used Ruler! Now he can figure out the length of things!</p></blockquote>
<p>The music is also fantastic, I own the entire thing.<p>
<p>Basically, everything about Earthbound is amazing. I never got bored while playing, and actually felt happiness surge into me as I opened up the game and heard the title music.</p>
<p>Here's the trailer from when it re-released for the Wii U last year:</p>

<p>If you're not enticed at this point, you're a hopeless case.</p>
<p>The most surprising thing about this amazing and fun game was that I learned from it. Beyond all the fun humor, it gets dark in places, and there's insights if you look hard enough.</p>
<h1>Lessons Learned from Earthbound</h1>
<h2>1. Help people without expectations.</h2>
<p>A lot of what drives the story forward in Earthbound is your decision to help out random people. If you don't help out the right people, you'll have to find your way back and help out those people to move forward.</p>
<p>Let me give you an example of this. When you reach Dusty Dunes Desert, you find a miner who is hungry. You get 2 advantages from this. He lets you stay in the miner's shack for free, and also, he will give you whatever he mines up, which ends up being a huge diamond. With that diamond, you pay off the Runaway Five's debt, and they end up saving you in a multitude of situations.</p>
<p>Ness and his friends got at least 2x the help back by just being nice. There are plenty of other situations where being nice gives tons of rewards, and I feel that's applicable in real life.</p>
<p>Give without expectations, and you'll get help when you need it.</p>
<h2>2. Doing good work will give you more wealth in the end.</h2>
<p>Earthbound is an easy game. You kill, or as they say it, "tame" things, you get money, you buy better equipment with that money, which allows you to tame more challenging monsters, it goes on.</p>
<p>By eradicating the evil in the game, Ness and his friends become more wealthy than anyone would ever need to be. After a certain point, you will never be tight on cash again, and your bank balance will reach an absurdly high point. It's amazing.</p>
<p>Ness and his friends just wanted to do good work, and that's how they ended up with that absurdly high bank balance. In the above example with the diamond, they could've kept it and cashed it out (though that's impossible in the game), but in the end, the help they received from the Runaway Five was more than the diamond was ever worth.</p>
<h2>3. Explore everything.</h2>
<p>To move forward in Earthbound, there are specific places you have to go. They also aren't the most obvious places. You could read a walkthrough and know exactly where to go, but you'd be missing out on all the great humor around every single corner.</p>
<p>The best thing about Earthbound is that <em>the dialogue changes</em>. After you do something major (in the first town, it's defeating the local gang's leader), the dialogue of many of the characters change. It's fun to go back and see the differences, and yes, it adds many, many hours to gameplay, but it also makes the whole thing so much more fun and involved.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>I'd really like to play Earthbound again. Firstly, I will never get tired of the humor and the music, but secondly, I'm sure there's more nuggets of insights and lessons in it. There's a part of the game where the main character, Ness, must enter his own mind's world and his own dark side, and I'm sure that's not just there because it's wacky. The entire final boss battle is insane, as well. It's very dark and there's got to be something more. I just know there is.</p>
<p>If and when I do get to play Earthbound again, I may come away with a totally different set of lessons. We'll see!</p>
