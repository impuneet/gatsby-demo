<p>Sebastian Marshall has a post titled "<a href="http://sebastianmarshall.com/the-million-dollar-question">The Million Dollar Question</a>." Beyond being the most popular post on his site, it acts as the intro to his book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006M9T8NI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B006M9T8NI&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=radhimorab0c-20">Ikigai</a>, which is currently standing at the best book I've read in 2014. I seriously doubt anything in the next 8 months will beat it.</p>
<p>In order to understand what I address in this post, I recommend you click through and read <a href="http://sebastianmarshall.com/the-million-dollar-question">The Million Dollar Question</a>. It isn't long and it's incredibly powerful.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The Million Dollar Question Sebastian Marshall speaks of is "Why don't people do what matters to them?"</p>
<p>One answer is that what people say matters to them isn't the same as what truly matters to them. For the sake of this post, let's assume we know what truly matters to us.</p>
<p>Sebastian's answer is that "You won't be understood once you step off into the abyss."</p>
<p>If you want to downgrade from a house to an apartment, why aren't you doing it? Is it because it's hard to sell a house? Is it because you have too much stuff? Those are all details, and if this really mattered to you, you would've had them solved already, or at least put forth a plan to do so.</p>
<p>The truth is, you won't be understood once you step off into the abyss.</p>
<p>When you invite your friends over to the new apartment, you know they'll ask, "Are you in financial trouble? Is that why you had to sell the house?</p>
<p>You're not in financial trouble, you just wanted to get out of that big house.</p>
<p>"Why? What's the point?"</p>
<p>You don't want to own so much stuff, and the electric bills were quite high, and you only use one bedroom out of the five that were in that house...</p>
<p>"But you're a prominent young professional. You <em>need</em> a house."</p>
<p>There you have it. You won't be understood once you step off into the abyss.</p>
<p>Let's do another example. If you want to begin publishing your writing, as I do on this site, why aren't you doing it yet? Is it because you think you can only do so through gatekeepers like magazine editors? Is it because it's expensive? <a href="http://www.siteground.com/friends.htm?referrer_id=6953256">I can guarantee that it's not expensive.</a> Those are all details, and if this really mattered to you, you would already be doing it, or had a step-by-step plan to do so.</p>
<p>The truth is, you won't be understood once you step off into the abyss.</p>
<p>You know it inside. It's <em>weird</em> to publish thoughts to a website and it's <em>weird </em>to have a following and it's <em>weird </em>to try something new.</p>
<p>(By the way, if anyone's struggling with this, the only people from "the real world" who read my site are people I've explicitly told. No one else cares.)</p>
<p>I think this is a useless excuse.</p>
<p>Those of us who have stepped off into the abyss don't understand those who are teetering on the edge. It's so nice here. You get to meet extraordinary people and have amazing opportunities come your way.</p>
<p>You will lose the world you are in right now, sure, but when you jump and reach the bottom of the abyss, you'll realize you're not so alone after all.</p>
<p>You'll relate to these people and be totally understood, because these are <em>your</em> people. These are your fellows who understand because they stepped off into the abyss as well.</p>
<p>You won't be understood by your current peers once you step off into the abyss, but don't you want the kinds of peers who do step off into the abyss?</p>
