<p>I'm a high-school student, which means that the time from 7AM-4PM is generally spent on school. No, this does not include homework. This leaves me with 15 hours in each work day to:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Do Homework</strong>, along with studying.</li>
	<li><strong>Consume media </strong>(books, movies, music).</li>
	<li><strong>Exercise, Hygiene, and Dinner</strong>. Breakfast and lunch fall into the school day.</li>
	<li><strong>Be Social</strong>.</li>
	<li><strong>Sleep.</strong> Right, as if I have time for that given the above.</li>
</ul>

<p>Right now, I'm doing half of these with half of my heart. There are multiple reasons for this:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>School takes away more than time.</strong> I often come home devoid of energy. I also get very emotionally tired.</li>
	<li><strong>I'm behind. </strong>Homework, studying, emails, books, and sleep have piled up. I even took a day off to attempt to catch up, but the sheer number of priorities makes me freeze (Procrastination Reason #2).</li>
	<li><strong>I don't exercise.</strong> My diet is pretty good, but being active has been a lifelong struggle. Just as I found some activities that could be constant and normal, I couldn't partake in them due to health reasons.</li>
</ul>

<p>In a perfect world, I wouldn't have lost two months of summer break or two years of math classes, too.</p>

<p>Oh well. It's all said and gone. It's time to fix it. Unlike <a title="Lessons Learned from 9 Months in Isolation" href="http://www.rmorabia.com/self-development/">Lessons Learned from 9 Months in Isolation</a>, here we have a problem I'm struggling with and have no real expertise on. It's not too late to get this semester into my control.</p>

<h1>A Three-Step Process for Life Control:</h1>

<p>After learning how to think and understanding awareness (post coming soon), you have to implement that knowledge into your life. Before all of the positivity comes out from your new-found awesomeness, you have to be on a neutral setting. I've developed a three-step process for gaining control of your life and starting at a base that no longer leaves you disadvantaged.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Filter</h2>

<p>I partake in a couple of energy and time-draining activities. I bet you do, too. If you don't know what's draining you, try being more self-aware. <a href="http://motivatedmastery.com/category/self-awareness/">Paul Jun has a whole bunch of wisdom on this topic.</a> I recommend it all.</p>

<p>After you know what's draining you, the hard part comes. This could be the hardest step to take. Clicking "Unsubscribe" or saying your goodbyes to that person or throwing away that expensive gadget is difficult. I'm still stuck on this step.</p>

<p>Think about the way this activity, person, or object holds you. You're wasting your life away on something that really doesn't care about you. You're trying to grow into a better person, but they haven't followed suit. Why are you still caring about it?</p>

<p>Again, this is not easy. You could relapse and fall right back into these habits you hate. It's a long, hard process, but it's worth it. If you don't know how to progress, <a href="http://www.theminimalists.com/start/">check out The Minimalists' archives</a>. They have solutions for the bad stuff, the bad gadgets, and the bad people. Get rid of them all.</p>

<p><a class="author id-t2_4kqj1" href="http://www.reddit.com/user/Wollff">Wollff</a> on Reddit offered an excellent viewpoint on how to filter:</p>

<blockquote><p>It is not an activity, person, or object that holds you. It is <em>you</em>, holding on to an activity, person, or object. By putting it the way you put it [above], you deny agency and shift the focus on stuff, instead of yourself.</p>

<p>You do care about the things you do. Everything we use to "waste our time" has a very real appeal. That appeal doesn't go away by writing one of those famous: "Do not press the red button!" - notes.</p>

<p>Appreciate your time wasters. Examine what they do for you. And accept what is attractive about them. Plan them into your life. And plan for failure. Have an exit strategy for when you notice that one of them is taking up more than its allotted share.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Step 2: Unobligate</h2>

<p>We've just gotten rid of everything you definitely never need to partake in ever again. There are still things that aren't really a huge negative force in your life, but you just feel a little obligated towards.</p>

<p>At one point, that blog was posting very good content. Some time in the past, that friend and I used to have very stimulating conversations. Once upon a time, I liked Facebook.</p>

<p>But none of these things are really helping me to sleep more, work better, or to be much happier. Here's what I'm doing to counter that:</p>

<p>I'm no longer responding to texts instantly or always being available on Skype or Facebook. Most of these conversations are trivial or repetitive. I don't care.</p>

<p>In fact, I'm uninstalling Skype and changing my phone's default mode to silent. (That means I'll only notice if I get a new message if I'm actively looking for it.)</p>

<p>If you're an RSS or newsletter addict, question who you're subscribed to. Even if you're a blogger yourself and want to retain relationships, a stream of mediocre isn't going to help you. If it's of quality, it'll find its way back to you.</p>

<p><strong>If something fails to add value to your life twice in a row, unobligate yourself.</strong> Whether this is a person you converse with regularly, a blog you subscribe to, a TV show that you thought you loved, or a workout routine, stop doing it and find better uses of your time and energy.</p>

<p><strong><em>NOTE</em></strong>: Long-term value must be taken into account here. If one of your reasons for sticking with an obligation that doesn't immediately add value is long-term value, make sure to assess this very meticulously. Compare effort with return. If the return isn't at least 1.2x the effort, it isn't worth it. (Don't know how to measure result versus effort? <a href="mailto:hi@rmorabia.com">Email me</a> and we can talk about how this relates to your specific situation.)</p>

<h2>Step 3: Automate</h2>

<p>Now, we find obligations that we still have to consider. If it's not <a href="http://calnewport.com/blog/2012/11/21/knowledge-workers-are-bad-at-working-and-heres-what-to-do-about-it/">deep work</a>, family time, or book time, it needs to be automated so meticulously that your body automatically knows what to do next, which leaves you more energy and time for the stuff that matters.</p>

<p>If you aren't in extreme control of your automation, your body also might automate in all the wrong ways. Right now, when my alarm goes off, I run up, turn it off, and jump back into bed. I've done this so many times now, that it's become a subconscious habit, and I barely remember it in the morning. This is the wrong type of automation, and exactly why you need to control your own scheduling and automation.</p>

<p>If you have recurring daily or weekly tasks, assign them to very specific times. Note that is does not mean "5 minutes to brush teeth at 6:25 every morning!" This means: "After I wake up around 6, I drink a liter of water, brush my teeth, prepare and eat breakfast," etc. The point is that you successively remember to do one thing after another. If this is too vague for you, try time-blocking. You assign a task or series of tasks to a vague period of time. For example, "Get ready for work between 6-8am." Within that period of time, do the succession of tasks. (If none of this is working for you, search up "How to Automate your Life" or something similar.)</p>

<h3>Conclusion:</h3>

<p>This is a very difficult plan. Each step requires tons of mental strain, clarity, accountability, and commitment. I've struggled with the first step for over a year, because I keep relapsing into negative activities. The biggest I can give you is to focus on step two, and when you've got step one under control, move on to step two. When you have step two under control, finally work on step three. If you don't, you'll get overwhelmed. Finishing step three first is useless because step one would interrupt you constantly.</p>

<p>But until these three steps are taken, thriving on our limited time and energy is impossible.</p>
