<h2>Hey! I'm Radhika Morabia, and I write about maximizing potential, creating opportunity, and living a life of adventure. I actually try and do that stuff, too.</h2>

<p>If that sounds like your thing, you've come to the right place.</p>

<p>I send out a newsletter each and every Monday about pursuing excellence, supercharging success, becoming the best you can be.</p>

<p>Still with me? Good.</p>
