<p>Hi. My name is Radhika Morabia. I write, explore, experiment, and think out loud.</p>

<p>This is my personal website documenting my journey towards excellence.</p>

<h2>What can you expect from rmorabia.com?</h2>

<p>I started rmorabia.com in September of 2013 and have since published over 50,000 words about achieving greatness, becoming a better person, and living in an unconventional manner.</p>
