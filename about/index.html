<p>Hi. My name is Radhika Morabia and this is my place on the web.</p>

<h2>About This Site</h2>

<p><code>rmorabia.com</code> is the personal website of Radhika Morabia.</p>

<p>This is my personal database, which covers my interest in success, freedom, independence, and not being <a href="http://rmorabia.com/pseudo">pseudo.</p>

<p>This manifests in a lot of content about the open web, the human self and human rationality, reflections on life, quotes from awesome people, and reviews of everything I've ever consumed.</p>

<p>This all stemmed from a single quote:</p>

<blockquote>What sort of writing could you create if you worked on it (be it ever so rarely) for the next 60 years? What could you do if you started <em>now</em>? <cite><a href="http://www.gwern.net/About">Gwern</a></cite></blockquote>

<p>My goal with this website is to constantly have it grow until one year, five years, fifty years from now, I look back, and I am able to see my own growth through it.</p>

<p>This will all be done through blog posts, and hopefully, by writing a little bit every single day. Unlike blog posts, though, where you hit (write) and run (never edit), most of the writing on this website will be constantly editing old posts.</p>

<p>Everything is a draft. Using a version control system like Git for my <a href="https://github.com/rmorabia/rmorabia.github.io">source code</a> will allow me to track any and all changes I make at any moment in the future.</p>

<p>This website is coded entirely by me, with help from <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, to help manage posts and allow me to code less, and from the <a href="http://purecss.io">Pure CSS Framework</a>, so that my site will work on any device.</p>

<p>The domain <code>rmorabia.com</code> is currently registered with <a href="http://godaddy.com">GoDaddy</a>. (I'm switching to <a href="http://gandi.net">Gandi</a> once my domain expires.) This site and its source code are hosted by <a href="http://github.com/">Github</a>. This might change in the future, as well, as Github only works for very simple, totally static websites.</p>

<p>Everything I coded is released entirely into the public domain, although Jekyll is using the <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/blob/master/LICENSE">MIT License</a> and Pure is using the <a href="https://github.com/yui/pure/blob/master/LICENSE.md">BSD License. I also use the Lato and Merriweather fonts on this website, and those belong to their respected owners.</p>

<p>Why release all my writing, code, design, etc., into the public domain? Why not? If you'd like to quote my writing, or learn from my code, or outright copy my entire website and put it up on another domain, go right ahead! I don't want to deal with the hassle of "Do I have permission?" emails, although I'd appreciate it if you <a href="mailto:hi@rmorabia.com">told me</a> what you were using my stuff for.</p>

<p>This website is constantly being changed. If you find an error or have a design suggestion, I'd really appreciate it if you <a href="mailto:hi@rmorabia.com">contacted me.</a></p>

<h2>About Me</h2>
