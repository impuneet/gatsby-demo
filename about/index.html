Hi. My name is Radhika Morabia and this is my place on the web. This site exists to document my interest in <a href="http://rmorabia.com/tag/success">success</a>, the human self, <a href="http://rmorabia.com/pseudo">the constant struggle of not being pseudo</a>, and the open web. I post <a href="http://rmorabia.com/category/quotes">quotes</a>, reflections on life, and plenty of other awesome stuff.
</p>
<p>
I'm a high school junior who's obsessed with success and am constantly working towards it. I love books, music, movies (mostly Bollywood), and video games. I'm willing and eager to talk about any of these.
</p>
<p>  
If you want to get more personal with me, I have a private list for just that. Check it out at <a href="http://rmorabia.com/thoughts">Uncensored Thoughts</a>.

Although I have social media accounts, I don't use them actively. To contact me, please see the <a href="http://rmorabia.com/contact">Contact</a> page.
