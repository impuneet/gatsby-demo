<p>Hi. My name is Radhika Morabia and this is my place on the web.</p>

<h2>About This Site</h2>

<p><code>rmorabia.com</code> is the personal website of Radhika Morabia. I've published over 50,000 words since the inception in September of 2013 with an average of 1669 words per post.</p>

<p>This is my personal database, which covers my interest in success, freedom, independence, and not being <a href="http://rmorabia.com/pseudo">pseudo</a>.</p>

<p>This manifests in a lot of content about the open web, the human self and rationality, reflections on life, quotes from awesome people, and reviews of everything I've ever consumed.</p>

<p>This all stemmed from a single quote:</p>

<blockquote>What sort of writing could you create if you worked on it (be it ever so rarely) for the next 60 years? What could you do if you started <em>now</em>? <cite><a href="http://www.gwern.net/About">Gwern</a></cite></blockquote>

<p>My goal with this website is to constantly have it grow until one year, five years, fifty years from now, I look back, and I am able to see my own growth through it.</p>

<p>This will all be done through blog posts, and hopefully, by writing a little bit every single day. Unlike blog posts, though, where you hit (write) and run (never edit), most of the writing on this website will be constantly editing old posts.</p>

<p>Everything is a draft. Using a version control system like Git for my <a href="https://github.com/rmorabia/rmorabia.github.io">source code</a> will allow me to track any and all changes I make at any moment in the future.</p>

<p>This website is coded entirely by me, with help from <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, to help manage posts and allow me to code less, and from the <a href="http://purecss.io">Pure CSS Framework</a>, so that my site will work on any device.</p>

<p>The domain <code>rmorabia.com</code> is currently registered with <a href="http://godaddy.com">GoDaddy</a>. (I'm switching to <a href="http://gandi.net">Gandi</a> once my domain expires.) This site and its source code are hosted by <a href="http://github.com/">Github</a>. This might change in the future, as well, as Github only works for very simple, totally static websites.</p>

<p>Everything I coded is released entirely into the public domain, although Jekyll is using the <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/blob/master/LICENSE">MIT License</a> and Pure is using the <a href="https://github.com/yui/pure/blob/master/LICENSE.md">BSD License</a>. I also use the Lato and Merriweather fonts on this website, and those belong to their respected owners.</p>

<p>Why release all my writing, code, design, etc., into the public domain? Why not? If you'd like to quote my writing, or learn from my code, or outright copy my entire website and put it up on another domain, go right ahead! I don't want to deal with the hassle of "Do I have permission?" emails, although I'd appreciate it if you <a href="http://rmorabia.com/contact">told me</a> what you were using my stuff for.</p>

<p>The best way to receive updates to all changes is by signing up for the <a href="http://mad.ly/signups/103121/join">monthly newsletter</a>. Although I have RSS feeds, they paint an inaccurate picture of what I'm writing every day.</p>

<p>This website is constantly being changed. If you find an error or have a design suggestion, I'd really appreciate it if you <a href="http://rmorabia.com/contact">contacted me</a>.</p>

<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>My name is Radhika Morabia. I'm a 17 year-old from the suburbs of Los Angeles, California who is currently learning web development and working on this website.</p>

<h3>My Beliefs:</h3>

<p>Although I'm currently trying to <a href="http://rmorabia.com/alinsky">stay unaffiliated</a>, I have a core set of beliefs that define everything I do. Also, this is constantly changing. I don't know enough about the world yet (and I doubt I ever will) to say that these are my final beliefs.</p>
<ul><li>I believe in equality.</li>
	<li>I believe that all races, genders, sexualities, and people deserve the same potential to do whatever they want.</li>
	<li>I believe that everyone should be able to do whatever they want, as long as they don't hurt anyone else while doing it. If they do hurt someone else, then it is a crime. The potential to hurt is not a crime.</li>
	<li>I believe in open source and free as in freedom. I don't believe charging for your work is wrong, as long as you don't restrict sharing.</li>
	<li>Any and all DRM is evil.</li>
	<li>I believe in open access.</li>
	<li>I believe in autonomy, independence, and freedom. I'm not sure if I believe in this on a personal scale or on a mass scale.</li>
	<li>I believe in nurture over nature. Even if they prove that I'm not good enough through nature, I believe that my nurture will get me to wherever I want to be.</li>
	<li>I believe in constant acquisition of knowledge and skills. There is no enough, but that doesn't mean you can't create, as well.</li>
	<li>I don't believe in formal institutions and being drafted into a school system.</li>
	<li>I don't believe in the military, at least not to the scale that the US has it.</li>
	<li>I believe in making an impact.</li>
	<li>I believe in myself.</li>
	<li>I believe, although quantitative measurements like a bank balance or certificates is an easy way to measure your self-worth, that your self-worth comes entirely from yourself.</li>
	<li>I believe human potential is vastly underused.</li>
	<li>I believe recreational drug use is the the dumbest thing you can do. The less harmful it is (alcohol, tobacco), the more useless it is.</li>
	<li>I believe the greatest people in the world became the greatest people in the world because they chose to be, not because of luck, chance, or genetics.</li>
	<li>I believe veganism is morally correct, and opting to use anything from animals (other creatures very similar to us) is immoral.</li>
	<li>I believe in human rationality.</li>
	<li>I believe in a distributed everything.</li></ul>
