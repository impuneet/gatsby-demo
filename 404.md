# Hey! You've landed on something that no longer exists.

Why's that? As I've grown and changed as a person, a lot of what I've written in the past is no longer relevant.

I only want to share the things that I legitimately believe in, and whatever was supposed to be here is something I no longer believe in.

Want to check out what I currently believe in? Join my weekly newsletter. It's free!
