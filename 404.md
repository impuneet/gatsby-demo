# This post doesn't exist anymore.

Why's that?

I focus on only sharing things that I find valuable and timeless. The post you were linked to didn't fulfill your requirements.

I would say I'm sorry, but I just saved you 5 minutes of your life. If you have 5 minutes to spare and are interested in maximizing your potential, living a life of adventure, and creating opportunity, check out some other things I've written on the topic:

<p><ul>
  {% for post in site.posts %}
    <li>
      <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>  - {{ post.date | date: "%B %d, %Y" }}
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul></p>
